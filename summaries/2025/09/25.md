# Activity Summary for 9/25/2025

## 12:52:22 PM
The log shows modifications to `FtpFileService.php` between 12:21 PM and 12:24 PM on September 25, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be improving the `getDiskConnection` method's robustness.

Initially, the `getDiskConnection` method included a `dd($disk)` statement for debugging purposes and lacked comprehensive error handling.  A subsequent revision removed the `dd()` and added a `try-catch` block to handle potential exceptions during connection, logging errors using `DebugLog::saveInLog`.

The `getDiskConnection_deprecated` method remained largely unchanged, indicating a refactoring effort to consolidate FTP connection logic into the primary `getDiskConnection` method.  The primary change in this method was that the `dd` statement was removed. A `dd($adapter)` statement was added in the final revision to the file, suggesting ongoing debugging related to the FTP adapter.  The other methods in the file were not substantively changed during this period.  The overall pattern is one of iterative debugging and refinement of the FTP connection handling within the class, aiming for improved error management and reliability.
