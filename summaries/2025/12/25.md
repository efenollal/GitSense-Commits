# Activity Summary for 12/25/2025

## 3:24:38 AM
The code changes primarily revolve around a data synchronization system integrating two distinct data sources, PlotBox and HMIS, with HubSpot CRM. The updates span several components, including data mappers, Eloquent models for data retrieval, core HubSpot service logic, and service provider configuration.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`** (12/22/2025, 5:26:50 PM & 5:39:32 PM):
    *   This mapper is responsible for transforming `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` into HubSpot contact and deal structures.
    *   It initializes `HubSpotOwnerService` and `HubSpotLocationService` for fetching relevant HubSpot data (owners, locations).
    *   Includes a destructor for resource cleanup (`ownersList`, `allLocations`, services).
    *   Methods like `mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, and `mapDeal` prepare data for HubSpot, standardizing fields such as `loc_id`, `state`, `pipeline`, `hubspot_owner_id`, and `dealstage`.
    *   It conditionally merges pre-need item counts into primary contact data based on the `HUBSPOT_PLOTBOX_ALLOW_ITEMS_COUNT` environment variable.
    *   **Significant Change (5:39:32 PM):** The `listAllLocations()` method was refactored to reuse the existing `$this->locationService` instance and call `listAllLocationsWithCache()`, improving consistency and potentially leveraging caching.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\HmisDataToCrmMapper.php`** (12/22/2025, 5:30:12 PM):
    *   Similar to the PlotBox mapper, this file maps `HubSpotDataTransferObject` (HMIS specific) to HubSpot contacts and deals.
    *   It uses `hmis` as the source identifier for HubSpot services.
    *   `mapContact` and `mapDeceasedContact` append `@everstorypartners.com` to the `dealOwnerUserName` for HubSpot owner email.
    *   The `formatMappedFields` method includes HMIS-specific pipeline logic (e.g., `an_fh`).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`** (12/22/2025, 5:30:34 PM & 5:43:57 PM):
    *   This Eloquent model connects to a Snowflake database to retrieve PlotBox contact and contract data.
    *   The `getDataWithDateRange` method executes a complex SQL query involving multiple CTEs (`base_contracts`, `contract_writers`, `item_counts`, `primary_contacts`, `deceased_contacts`) to gather comprehensive contract, contact, and item count information for a specified date range.
    *   **Significant Change (5:43:57 PM):** The `limit 2` clause was removed from the SQL query within `getDataWithDateRange`, indicating a shift from fetching a limited number of records (likely for testing or debugging) to retrieving all relevant data for the specified date range.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\config\services.php`** (12/22/2025, 5:35:58 PM):
    *   This configuration file centralizes HubSpot-related settings.
    *   It defines various HubSpot API tokens, base URLs, association type IDs for contacts, deals, and locations, lifecycle stages, and pipeline IDs.
    *   It also includes detailed `deal_search_config` and `sources` configurations for both 'hmis' and 'plotbox', specifying search properties and fields to fetch from HubSpot, ensuring consistent API interactions.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`** (12/22/2025, 5:31:15 PM):
    *   Orchestrates the synchronization of PlotBox data to HubSpot.
    *   The `syncPlotBoxData` method fetches data, maps it, and then calls `processContacts` to handle the creation, updating, and association of primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals in HubSpot.
    *   It includes robust error handling with `try-catch` blocks and extensive logging at each processing stage.
    *   `sleep()` calls are strategically placed, likely to manage HubSpot API rate limits or allow for asynchronous processing.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Hmis\HmisHubSpotService.php`** (12/22/2025, 5:36:18 PM):
    *   Mirrors the structure and functionality of `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` but for HMIS data.
    *   The `syncData` method specifically differentiates and processes 'SHIPOUT' type records separately from other HMIS data, suggesting a unique handling requirement for this service type.
    *   The `processContacts` method is nearly identical to its PlotBox counterpart, including logging, error handling, `sleep()` calls, and additional checks for contact and deal owner existence before updates.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\Hmis\Sale.php`** (12/22/2025, 5:42:08 PM & 5:43:47 PM):
    *   This Eloquent model connects to a SQL Server database for HMIS sales data.
    *   The `getDataWithDateRange` method executes a complex SQL query joining multiple tables (`Sales`, `Name`, `Sales_Finance`, `Location`, `CafeCase`, `CafeEmployee`, `CafeCasePerson`, `CafeArrangement`, `CafeArrangementService`) to compile comprehensive sales, contact, and service information for a date range.
    *   **Significant Change (5:43:47 PM):** Similar to the PlotBox `Contact` model, the `->limit(2)` clause was removed from the query, enabling the retrieval of all sales records within the specified date range.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Providers\HubSpotServiceProvider.php`** (12/22/2025, 5:50:06 PM):
    *   This Laravel service provider is responsible for registering and configuring the `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` within the application's dependency injection container.
    *   It injects necessary dependencies like `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, and `EloquentHubSpotRepository` (configured with the appropriate `PlotBox\Contact` or `Hmis\Sale` models) along with API tokens. This centralizes the instantiation logic and ensures proper service setup.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

The changes are concentrated on **December 22, 2025**, indicating active development and refinement of the HubSpot integration. Key changes include:
*   **5:30:34 PM (PlotBox\Contact.php)** and **5:42:08 PM (Hmis\Sale.php)**: Initial versions of data retrieval queries.
*   **5:43:47 PM (Hmis\Sale.php)** and **5:43:57 PM (PlotBox\Contact.php)**: Removal of `limit 2` from data retrieval queries, suggesting a transition to full data syncing.
*   **5:39:32 PM (PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php)**: Minor refactoring for service reuse within the mapper.
*   **5:50:06 PM (HubSpotServiceProvider.php)**: Finalized service registration, indicating preparation for a comprehensive deployment or testing cycle for the entire HubSpot integration.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Modular HubSpot Integration:** The system follows a clear pattern of modularizing HubSpot integration by data source:
    *   Dedicated Eloquent models (`PlotBox\Contact`, `Hmis\Sale`) for fetching raw data.
    *   Specific mappers (`PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`, `HmisDataToCrmMapper`) for transforming data to HubSpot formats.
    *   Distinct HubSpot service classes (`PlotBoxHubSpotService`, `HmisHubSpotService`) for orchestrating the sync logic, including search, create, update, and association operations.
*   **Data Transformation:** Both mappers utilize a `formatMappedFields` method to standardize data, including uppercasing states, standardizing relationship text, and mapping pipeline/dealstage values based on configuration. They also involve converting date strings to epoch milliseconds.
*   **Robustness and Logging:** The HubSpot service classes for both PlotBox and HMIS demonstrate a strong emphasis on robustness with extensive `try-catch` blocks, detailed logging of success and failure states, and `sleep()` calls, likely to handle API rate limits and ensure processing time.
*   **Centralized Configuration:** The `config/services.php` file acts as a central repository for all HubSpot-related configuration, making it easy to manage API keys, URLs, and various object and association type IDs.
*   **Dependency Injection:** `HubSpotServiceProvider` demonstrates the use of Laravel's dependency injection to manage the creation and provision of HubSpot service instances, promoting testability and maintainability.
*   **SQL Query Complexity:** Both `PlotBox\Contact` and `Hmis\Sale` models execute complex SQL queries involving multiple joins and CTEs (in PlotBox's case) to gather a comprehensive dataset for HubSpot synchronization.
*   **Shift to Full Sync:** The removal of `limit 2` from the `getDataWithDateRange` methods in both PlotBox and HMIS models strongly suggests a move from fetching limited test data to executing full data synchronization for the specified date ranges.

## 2:00:58 PM
The changes primarily revolve around enhancing and maintaining the integration of PlotBox and HMIS data with HubSpot CRM, focusing on data mapping, syncing processes, and service provider configurations. The updates were recorded on December 22, 2025, spanning from 5:26:50 PM to 5:50:06 PM.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php` (5:26:50 PM & 5:39:32 PM):**
    *   Initially, the `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` class was updated to include a destructor for cleaning up resources (`ownersList`, `allLocations`, `ownerService`, `locationService`).
    *   The constructor was enhanced to load various HubSpot configuration values (lifecycle stages, pipelines, deal stages) and includes `usleep` calls, indicating pauses for API rate limiting or system stability.
    *   New mapping logic for primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals was added, including the generation of deal names and formatting of fields like `loc_id`, `state`, `relationship_to_the_deceased`, `pipeline`, and `dealstage` to match HubSpot's expected format.
    *   A significant addition was the `mergePreNeedItemCountsToPrimaryContact` method, which conditionally merges item counts (e.g., caskets_owned, cremation_products_owned) into primary contact data for 'pre-need' pipelines, controlled by a `HUBSPOT_PLOTBOX_ALLOW_ITEMS_COUNT` environment variable.
    *   A minor revision at 5:39:32 PM updated the `listAllLocations` method to correctly use the existing `$this->locationService` instance to fetch all locations with caching, instead of creating a new `HubSpotLocationService` instance.

*   **`app\Mappers\HmisDataToCrmMapper.php` (5:30:12 PM):**
    *   This mapper class, conceptually similar to its PlotBox counterpart, was updated to handle HMIS-specific data.
    *   It defines methods for mapping primary contacts, deceased contacts (including `religious_affilation` and `date_of_burial_memorial_service`), and deals to HubSpot.
    *   Notably, it appends `@everstorypartners.com` to the `dealOwnerUserName` for HubSpot owner IDs.
    *   The `formatMappedFields` method includes HMIS-specific pipeline mapping (`'an_fh'` to at-need pipeline).
    *   Unlike the PlotBox mapper, this version does not include an explicit destructor or the item count merging logic.

*   **`app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` (5:30:34 PM & 5:43:57 PM):**
    *   The Eloquent model for PlotBox contacts was updated with a complex SQL query in `getDataWithDateRange`. This query retrieves a comprehensive set of data, including primary and deceased contact details, contract information, contract writer details, and a detailed breakdown of item counts (caskets, cremation products, ground, markers, etc.) from Snowflake.
    *   Initially, the SQL query at 5:30:34 PM included a `limit 2` clause, which was likely for testing or development purposes.
    *   This `limit 2` clause was **removed** in the subsequent update at 5:43:57 PM, indicating a transition to fetching all relevant data.

*   **`app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` (5:31:15 PM):**
    *   This service class defines the core logic for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot.
    *   It orchestrates fetching data, mapping it using `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`, and then processing batches of primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals.
    *   The `processContacts` method implements a resilient syncing strategy, wrapping each major operation (contact creation/update, deal creation/update, various associations) in individual `try-catch` blocks to prevent a single failure from halting the entire sync.
    *   It includes `sleep` calls between processing steps (e.g., after primary and deceased contacts, and after deals) to manage HubSpot API rate limits or allow for data propagation.
    *   It handles associations between primary contacts, deceased contacts, deals, and HubSpot locations, logging success or failure for each association.

*   **`config\services.php` (5:35:58 PM):**
    *   The service configuration file was extended to centralize HubSpot-related settings.
    *   It defines various HubSpot API tokens, URLs, association type IDs (contact-to-contact, contact-to-deal, next-of-kin, location), lifecycle stages, pipeline IDs, and object type IDs.
    *   New `deal_search_config` and `sources` arrays were introduced to define properties for searching deals and fetching contact properties for both HMIS and PlotBox data sources, making the HubSpot integration more configurable and explicit.

*   **`app\SMCore\Services\Hmis\HmisHubSpotService.php` (5:36:18 PM):**
    *   This service class implements HMIS data syncing to HubSpot.
    *   A key feature is its ability to **differentiate between 'SHIPOUT' and non-'SHIPOUT' service types**, processing them in separate batches.
    *   Its `processContacts` method is structurally very similar to the PlotBox service, including `try-catch` blocks and `sleep` calls for resilience.
    *   A notable difference is the inclusion of `checkContactOwnerExists` and `checkDealOwnerExists` calls before updating contacts and deals, suggesting a specific requirement for HMIS data to verify owner existence.

*   **`app\Models\Hmis\Sale.php` (5:42:08 PM & 5:43:47 PM):**
    *   The Eloquent model for HMIS sales was updated with a SQL query in `getDataWithDateRange` to retrieve sales data from a SQL Server database. This query gathers comprehensive details about sales, purchasers, deceased individuals, and service arrangements.
    *   Similar to the PlotBox model, the initial version at 5:42:08 PM included a `limit 2` clause.
    *   This `limit 2` clause was **removed** at 5:43:47 PM, indicating the intent to process all matching HMIS sales records.

*   **`app\Providers\HubSpotServiceProvider.php` (5:50:06 PM):**
    *   This provider was updated to bind `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` to the Laravel service container.
    *   It ensures that each service is instantiated with its respective `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, and an `EloquentHubSpotRepository` configured with the correct model (`PlotBox\Contact` for PlotBox, `Hmis\Sale` for HMIS). This setup facilitates dependency injection and ensures that each integration works with its designated data source.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HubSpot Integration Focus:** The dominant theme across all changes is the robust integration with HubSpot CRM, including data mapping, contact/deal creation and updates, and various object associations (contact-to-contact, contact-to-deal, contact-to-location, deal-to-location).
*   **Resilient Processing:** Both `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` employ similar `processContacts` methods with extensive `try-catch` blocks for individual operations and strategic `sleep` calls. This pattern suggests a design for resilience against API failures and rate limiting during bulk data synchronization.
*   **Data Source Specific Mappers:** Dedicated mapper classes (`PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`, `HmisDataToCrmMapper`) are used to transform data from their respective source systems into a HubSpot-compatible format.
*   **Centralized Configuration:** The `config/services.php` file now centralizes HubSpot API settings and object type IDs, promoting easier management and consistent application of these values across different services.
*   **`limit` Clause for Development:** The repeated introduction and subsequent removal of a `limit 2` clause in the `getDataWithDateRange` SQL queries for both `PlotBox\Contact` and `Hmis\Sale` models suggests a common development practice of limiting result sets during initial testing phases to avoid processing large amounts of data.
*   **Owner and Location Services:** Both mappers and services consistently leverage `HubSpotOwnerService` and `HubSpotLocationService` for retrieving and caching owner lists and location IDs, crucial for accurately assigning records in HubSpot.
*   **Date-based Data Retrieval:** Both data models (`PlotBox\Contact` and `Hmis\Sale`) provide `getDataWithDateRange` methods, enabling synchronization based on `Last_Update_Dt`.

## 9:40:00 PM

    *   Extensive `try-catch` blocks and logging are used for robust error handling.
    *   Includes `sleep` calls (e.g., `sleep(10)`, `sleep(5)`) within `processContacts` to manage HubSpot API rate limits or ensure data propagation before subsequent operations.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\config\services.php`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/22/2025, 5:35:58 PM**
    *   This configuration file centralizes settings for third-party services, including HubSpot.
    *   It defines various HubSpot API tokens (from `.env`), association type IDs, lifecycle stages, pipeline IDs, and deal stage IDs.
    *   Detailed `deal_search_config` and `sources` configurations are provided for both HMIS and PlotBox, specifying properties for searching and fetching HubSpot records.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Hmis\HmisHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/22/2025, 5:36:18 PM**
    *   This service handles HMIS data synchronization to HubSpot, mirroring the `PlotBoxHubSpotService`.
    *   It uses `HmisDataToCrmMapper` and separates processing logic for "SHIPOUT" and "non-SHIPOUT" service types, creating distinct batches for each.
    *   The `processContacts` method is largely identical to the one in `PlotBoxHubSpotService`, managing contact and deal operations, associations, and includes similar `sleep` intervals.
    *   It also contains `checkContactOwnerExists` and `checkDealOwnerExists` before updating records, a detail not explicitly present in the provided `PlotBoxHubSpotService` log.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\Hmis\Sale.php`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/22/2025, 5:42:08 PM & 12/22/2025, 5:43:47 PM**
    *   This Eloquent model manages HMIS sales data, connecting to an SQL Server database.
    *   It defines relationships to `Name`, `SalesFinance`, `Location`, and `CafeCase` models.
    *   The static `getDataWithDateRange` method performs a complex SQL query with multiple joins to retrieve sales, purchaser, deceased, employee, and service arrangement details, filtered by sales status, type, and location availability.
    *   `getHubspotData` wraps `getDataWithDateRange` for current day data.
    *   **Significant Change (5:43:47 PM):** Similar to the PlotBox `Contact` model, the `limit 2` clause was removed from the `getDataWithDateRange` SQL query, implying a shift to retrieving all pertinent records for synchronization.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Providers\HubSpotServiceProvider.php`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/22/2025, 5:50:06 PM**
    *   This service provider registers the `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` with the Laravel application container.
    *   It configures their dependencies, injecting `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, and `EloquentHubSpotRepository` with their respective API tokens and model classes (`\App\Models\PlotBox\Contact::class` and `\App\Models\Hmis\Sale::class`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent HubSpot Integration Strategy:** Both PlotBox and HMIS integrations follow a similar architecture:
    *   **Data Models:** Dedicated Eloquent models for data retrieval from source systems (Snowflake for PlotBox, SQL Server for HMIS).
    *   **Mappers:** Mapper classes to transform source data into a standardized HubSpot DTO format.
    *   **Services:** Orchestration services to manage the end-to-end sync process (fetch, map, search, create/update, associate).
*   **Timestamp Synchronization:** Both systems rely on `last_update_dt` and `Date_Of_Birth`/`Date_Of_Death` fields, often converted to epoch milliseconds or midnight UTC, indicating a focus on tracking changes and date-based processing.
*   **Configuration-Driven Approach:** Critical HubSpot parameters (association types, pipeline IDs, deal stages, tokens) are centralized in `config/services.php` and loaded from environment variables, allowing for flexible deployment and management.
*   **Resilience and Rate Limiting:** Extensive use of `try-catch` blocks at granular levels within the service processing, along with `sleep` and `usleep` calls, highlights a design for robust error handling and adherence to HubSpot API rate limits.
*   **Granular Data Mapping:** Both mappers meticulously map numerous fields from source data to specific HubSpot properties for contacts (primary and deceased) and deals.
*   **Association Management:** The system consistently creates multiple types of associations in HubSpot: primary-deceased contact, contact-deal, contact-location, and deal-location.
*   **Query Evolution:** The removal of `limit 2` from data retrieval queries in both `PlotBox\Contact` and `Hmis\Sale` models, occurring around the same time, strongly suggests a progression from testing/development data fetching to full production-scale data retrieval.
*   **HubSpot Object Types:** Consistent use of `0-1` for contacts and `0-3` for deals when associating with locations, as defined in configuration.
