# Activity Summary for 12/9/2025

## 3:17:56 AM
The changes log indicates ongoing development related to data synchronization between an internal HMIS/PlotBox system and HubSpot CRM, focusing on contacts and deals. The timestamps span from November 20, 2025, to December 8, 2025, with frequent updates on specific days, suggesting an active development or debugging phase.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Hmis\HmisHubSpotService.php`** (Multiple entries from 11/20/2025, 7:36 PM to 8:15 PM, and 11/21/2025, 1:18 PM to 12/8/2025, 10:28 PM):
    *   This file is central to the HMIS to HubSpot data synchronization.
    *   Early changes involve slight modifications, including commented-out lines like `$dealsToUpdate = $this->checkDealOwnerExists($dealsToCreateOrUpdate['to_update']);` and `dd($deceasedContactBatch, $dealsBatch);`, indicating debugging and testing within the `processContacts` and `syncData` methods. These `dd()` (dump and die) statements are usually temporary debugging tools.
    *   The `syncData` method handles different `serviceTypeCode`s, distinguishing between regular processing and 'SHIPOUT' contacts/deals.
    *   The `processContacts` method is responsible for searching, creating, updating, and associating primary and deceased contacts and deals in HubSpot, including associating them with locations. Error logging (`Log::error`) is consistently implemented for resilience in each step (contact creation/update, association, deal processing).
    *   A significant change occurred around `12/8/2025, 10:35 AM` onwards, where the service began explicitly importing `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` and adopted a `HubSpotRepositoryInterface` in its constructor. The `syncData` method was renamed to `syncPlotBoxData` and modified to specifically handle PlotBox data, including conditional `dd($this->plotBoxData);` and commented-out `SHIPOUT` processing, suggesting a shift or expansion to integrate PlotBox data. The `mapper` is now lazily loaded via `getMapper()`. The `processContacts` method was updated to remove `checkContactOwnerExists` and `checkDealOwnerExists` calls, simplifying the update logic.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\HmisDataToCrmMapper.php`** (Multiple entries from 11/20/2025, 7:41 PM to 9:07 PM):
    *   This mapper is responsible for transforming HMIS data into a format suitable for HubSpot.
    *   Updates include changes to how `hubspot_owner_id` is assigned in `mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, and `mapDeal`. Initially, it directly used `trim($hmisDto->dealOwnerUserName) . '@everstorypartners.com'`, but at `11/20/2025, 7:54 PM`, it was temporarily hardcoded to `'cking@everstorypartners.com'` before being reverted back to the original dynamic assignment at `11/20/2025, 8:01 PM`.
    *   New fields `date_of_burial_memorial_service` (for deceased contacts) and `date_of_service` (for deals) were introduced and mapped using `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis()` (e.g., `11/20/2025, 8:30 PM`). There was a typo (`$htmisDto`) that was corrected to `$hmisDto` at `11/20/2025, 8:34 PM`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotContactService.php`** (Single entry on 11/20/2025, 7:41 PM):
    *   This service handles HubSpot contact interactions.
    *   The primary change noted is the explicit removal of `loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, and `service_type_code` properties before creating or updating contacts in HubSpot. This ensures only relevant data is sent to the CRM.
    *   Error handling within `createContact` and `updateContact` was improved to log specific errors for individual contacts but allow the process to continue for others.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\Hmis\Sale.php`** (Multiple entries from 11/20/2025, 7:41 PM to 9:09 PM):
    *   This Eloquent model defines how HMIS sales data is retrieved.
    *   Key changes involve expanding the `select` statement in `getHmisDataWithDateRange` to include `CAS.ServiceDate AS Service_Date` and `CAS.Sevice_Type_Cd AS Service_Type_Code` for service-related data, reflecting new data requirements for HubSpot.
    *   Temporary `limit(1)` or `limit(5)` clauses were added to the `getHmisDataWithDateRange` method at various points (e.g., `11/20/2025, 7:52 PM`, `8:36 PM`, `8:49 PM`, `9:03 PM`) and then removed, indicating localized testing with a small subset of data. A specific `where('Sales.CaseKey', '=', '265707')` was also temporarily added for focused debugging.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotDealService.php`** (Multiple entries from 11/20/2025, 7:52 PM to 12/8/2025, 10:32 PM):
    *   This service manages HubSpot deal interactions.
    *   Similar to the `HubSpotContactService`, explicit removal of `loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, and `hmis_account_number` properties is implemented before creating or updating deals.
    *   The `updateDeal` method saw a commented-out line `// $dealsToUpdate = $this->checkDealOwnerExists($dealsToCreateOrUpdate['to_update']);` at `11/20/2025, 7:58 PM`, which was then un-commented and re-commented at various points, indicating a back-and-forth decision or testing around owner existence checks before updating deals. The final version before the PlotBox changes does include this line.
    *   After `12/5/2025`, the `hmis_account_number` was removed from properties to unset before sending to HubSpot, which is consistent with the shift towards PlotBox data where a different account number property might be used.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Data\HubSpotDataTransferObject.php`** (Multiple entries from 11/20/2025, 8:32 PM to 12/5/2025, 3:31 PM):
    *   This DTO defines the structure for HMIS data being transferred to HubSpot.
    *   It was updated to include `$serviceDate` property at `11/20/2025, 8:32 PM`.
    *   A significant, but quickly reverted, change occurred at `12/5/2025, 3:26 PM`, where new integer properties for product counts (e.g., `casketsCount`, `cremationProductCount`) were added, and then removed shortly after (`12/5/2025, 3:28 PM`), reverting the class to its previous state without these properties. This suggests a brief attempt to integrate product count data directly into this DTO, which was reconsidered.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Repositories\EloquentHubSpotRepository.php`** (Multiple entries from 11/20/2025, 9:02 PM to 12/8/2025, 10:10 PM):
    *   This repository handles fetching data for HubSpot synchronization.
    *   Initially, it had methods like `getHmisDataForCrmSync`.
    *   A major refactoring occurred around `11/25/2025, 5:01 PM`:
        *   It was made more generic by introducing a `$modelClass` property in the constructor, allowing it to work with different data sources (HMIS or PlotBox).
        *   The method names were generalized (e.g., `getHmisDataForCrmSync` became `getDataForCrmSync`).
        *   A `transformKeysToTitleCase` private method was added to convert database column names (e.g., `unique_key`) to a title-cased format (e.g., `Unique_Key`), which is then used by the DTOs.
        *   Conditional logic was introduced to map data to either `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` or `HubSpotDataTransferObject` based on the `$modelClass`. Null coalescing (`?? null`) was extensively added when constructing DTOs, making the data mapping more robust against missing fields.
        *   The `getDataForCrmSync` method was updated to handle both `getDataWithDateRange` and `getHubspotData` calls on the dynamic `$model`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Data\PlotBoxDataTransferObject.php`** (Multiple entries from 12/5/2025, 3:29 PM to 3:30 PM):
    *   This is a new DTO specifically for PlotBox data.
    *   Introduced with numerous properties, including product counts (e.g., `casketsCount`, `cremationProductCount`), `gender`, `maritalStatus`, and `purchaserRelationToTheDeceased`.
    *   Methods like `getFullName`, `getDeceasedFullName`, `hasValidEmail`, and `hasDeceasedContact` were added to encapsulate logic for PlotBox data.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`** (Multiple entries from 12/5/2025, 3:40 PM to 3:41 PM):
    *   This is a new mapper specifically for PlotBox data to HubSpot.
    *   It closely mirrors `HmisDataToCrmMapper` but is tailored for `PlotBoxDataTransferObject`.
    *   Notable differences include:
        *   `mapContact` and `mapDeceasedContact` use `plotbox_account_number` instead of `hmis_account_number`.
        *   `hubspot_owner_id` is now derived from `dealOwnerEmailAddress` (which is a JSON string) using a new helper method `getEmailFromJson`.
        *   `mapDeal` includes new fields for product counts (e.g., `caskets_count`, `cremation_product_count`, etc.) and uses `plotbox_key` and `contract_number`.
        *   It introduces `generateDealName` to create a descriptive deal name from PlotBox data.
        *   It has `listAllLocationsWithCache` suggesting caching mechanisms for locations.
        *   `atNeedPipeline` and `preNeedPipeline` configurations were commented out, suggesting these might be dynamically determined or less relevant for PlotBox integration.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`** (Multiple entries from 12/5/2025, 2:05 PM to 12/8/2025, 10:44 PM):
    *   This new Eloquent model interacts with a Snowflake database for PlotBox data.
    *   It defines the `CONTACT` table and its fillable fields.
    *   The `getDataWithDateRange` static method contains complex SQL queries using `WITH` clauses to join data from `DIM_CONTRACT`, `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`, `DIM_CONTACT`, `DIM_CONTRACT_ITEM`, `DIM_FEE`, and `DIM_FEE_CATEGORY`.
    *   This query specifically selects various contact and contract details, including primary and deceased contact information, sales contract number, pipeline, purchase price, and a new `product_counts` CTE to calculate quantities of different product types (caskets, cremation, ground, markers, mausoleum, niche, opening/closing, other merchandise, other services, private estates, urns, vaults) based on `FEE_CATEGORY_NAME` using `LIKE` clauses.
    *   There was a temporary `getDataWithDateRange1` method and several temporary `LIMIT` clauses (e.g., `LIMIT 5`, `LIMIT 20`) in the SQL queries, as well as commented-out sections of the old `getDataWithDateRange1` method, indicating extensive testing and refinement of the Snowflake query.
    *   A `getHubspotData` method was added to retrieve data for the current day.
    *   A `testSimpleQuery` method was added to verify the Snowflake database connection.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Console\Commands\Integration\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand.php`** (Multiple entries from 12/8/2025, 10:13 PM to 10:28 PM):
    *   This is a new Artisan command for initiating PlotBox data synchronization to HubSpot.
    *   It supports various date filtering options (`--date`, `--from-date`, `--to-date`, `--days-back`).
    *   It leverages `PlotBoxHubSpotService` to perform the sync and includes error handling with email notifications (`HmisErrorNotifications` - note: the class name still refers to HMIS).
    *   Temporary `var_dump` and `dd` statements were observed in the error handling section, again suggesting active debugging.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\helpers.php`** (Single entry on 11/20/2025, 8:40 PM):
    *   No significant functional changes, but includes helper functions like `response`, `format_currency`, `human_readable_duration`, `human_readable_filesize`, `array_diff_assoc_recursive`, `array_sort_keys_by_array`, `object_set_key_with_dot`, `object_forget_key_with_dot`, `exception_wrapper`, `http_headers`, `have_valid_debug_request_header`, `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis`, and `convert_utc_date_to_epoch`. This indicates a collection of utility functions.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HubSpot Integration Focus:** The vast majority of changes revolve around syncing data to HubSpot, involving services for contacts, deals, and locations.
*   **Data Transformation:** There's a clear pattern of mapping data from internal systems (HMIS, PlotBox) into a `HubSpotDataTransferObject` or `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` structure before interacting with the HubSpot API. This involves trimming strings, converting dates to epoch milliseconds, and looking up IDs (owners, locations).
*   **Robust Error Handling & Logging:** `try-catch` blocks with `Log::error` are consistently used throughout the HubSpot service classes (`HmisHubSpotService`, `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `PlotBoxHubSpotService`) to handle API exceptions and general errors, often continuing processing even if individual items fail. Detailed logging with JSON-encoded data is also common.
*   **Date Filtering for Sync:** The synchronization commands and repository methods consistently support various date-based filtering options (`--date`, `--from-date`, `--to-date`, `--days-back`) to control the scope of the data sync.
*   **Debugging Practices:** Frequent use of `dd()` (dump and die) and `var_dump()` statements in `HmisHubSpotService`, `PlotBoxHubSpotService`, `EloquentHubSpotRepository`, and `PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand` indicates active debugging sessions during development. Similarly, `LIMIT` clauses and specific `WHERE` conditions were temporarily added to SQL queries for focused testing.
*   **Abstraction and Generality:** The refactoring of `EloquentHubSpotRepository` to use a `$modelClass` property and a `HubSpotRepositoryInterface` suggests an effort to make the data retrieval layer more generic and extensible, allowing it to handle different source systems (HMIS, PlotBox) through polymorphism.
*   **Product Count Integration:** A new recurring theme, especially in the PlotBox related changes, is the addition of product count fields (caskets, cremation products, ground spaces, markers, etc.) to the data model and SQL queries. This indicates a new requirement to track detailed product sales in HubSpot.
*   **Code Duplication (Temporary):** The `getDataWithDateRange` method in `app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` initially had a duplicated SQL query, one of which was commented out and the other was expanded with product counts. This suggests an iterative development process where old logic is kept for comparison or temporary disabling.
*   **Specific HubSpot Configurations:** The frequent use of `config('services.hubspot....')` shows reliance on external configuration for HubSpot API access tokens, association type IDs, lifecycle stages, and pipeline IDs.
*   **Database Connectivity:** The log shows interactions with both `sqlsrv` (for HMIS data) and `snowflake` (for PlotBox data), indicating a multi-database environment.

In summary, this log illustrates a significant development effort to integrate PlotBox data into an existing HubSpot synchronization pipeline, alongside continued maintenance and debugging of the HMIS integration. Key changes include refactoring the repository for data source flexibility, introducing a new DTO and mapper for PlotBox data with detailed product metrics, and updating the synchronization service and command-line tool to support the new data source. The process involves careful data mapping, robust error handling, and visible debugging steps.

## 10:24:49 AM
The recent changes focus on extending the data synchronization capabilities from different source systems (HMIS and PlotBox) to HubSpot CRM. A significant architectural shift has been implemented to support multiple data sources.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Hmis\HmisHubSpotService.php` (11/20/2025, 7:36 PM - 9:03 PM):** This service, responsible for syncing HMIS data, saw several temporary debugging statements (`dd()`, commented-out lines) added and removed throughout the day. A notable change involved commenting out a check for deal owner existence during updates in the `processContacts` method (7:58:35 PM).
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\HmisDataToCrmMapper.php` (11/20/2025, 7:41 PM - 9:07 PM):**
    *   Briefly hardcoded `hubspot_owner_id` to a static email address (`'cking@everstorypartners.com'`) for testing purposes (7:54:31 PM), then reverted to dynamic assignment (8:01:01 PM).
    *   Introduced new fields `'deal_of_burial_memorial_service'` in `mapDeceasedContact` and `'date_of_service'` in `mapDeal` (8:30:47 PM).
    *   Corrected a typo (`$htmisDto` to `$hmisDto`) and updated date conversion logic for these new fields, switching from `convert_utc_date_to_epoch` to `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` (8:34:00 PM).
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotContactService.php` (11/20/2025, 7:41:39 PM):** This file remained stable, consistently unsetting specific properties (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `service_type_code`) before sending data to HubSpot and providing robust error handling for individual operations.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\Hmis\Sale.php` (11/20/2025, 7:41 PM - 9:09 PM):** The `getHmisDataWithDateRange` SQL query underwent frequent modifications for debugging, including:
    *   Adding and removing `LIMIT` clauses (`limit(1)`, `limit(5)`).
    *   Adding and removing a specific `WHERE` clause filtering by `Sales.CaseKey` (e.g., `'265707'`).
    *   Adding `CAS.ServiceDate AS Service_Date` to the select list, with a temporary aliasing mistake that was later corrected. These changes suggest iterative testing and refinement of the data extraction query.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotDealService.php` (11/20/2025, 7:52 PM - 12/8/2025, 10:32 PM):** This service remained consistent, similar to `HubSpotContactService`, in its approach to unsetting specific properties and handling errors for individual deal creation and updates.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\helpers.php` (11/20/2025, 8:40:10 PM):** This utility file was logged once and showed no changes, indicating it contains stable helper functions for common tasks, including date conversions relevant to data mapping.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Data\HubSpotDataTransferObject.php` (11/20/2025, 8:32 PM - 12/5/2025, 3:31 PM):**
    *   Initially, a `serviceDate` property was added.
    *   Experienced a brief period of adding and then removing various product count properties (`casketsCount`, `cremationProductCount`, etc.) around 12/5/2025, 3:26 PM, before settling back to a simpler set of string properties (3:29:55 PM).
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Repositories\EloquentHubSpotRepository.php` (11/20/2025, 9:02 PM - 11/25/2025, 5:07 PM):**
    *   Underwent a major refactoring on 11/25/2025 to generalize data fetching. It now dynamically instantiates models (`modelClass`) and conditionally maps data to either `HubSpotDataTransferObject` (for HMIS) or `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` (for PlotBox).
    *   A new private method `transformKeysToTitleCase` was introduced to standardize database column names.
    *   Null coalescing operators (`?? null`) were added extensively to DTO constructors to handle potentially missing data.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Data\PlotBoxDataTransferObject.php` (11/25/2025, 5:01 PM - 12/5/2025, 3:30 PM):** This new DTO was introduced for PlotBox data. It defines specific properties like `gender`, `maritalStatus`, `primaryDateOfBirth`, `dealOwnerEmailAddress`, `pipeline`, and numerous product `_Count` fields. It also includes helper methods for full name retrieval and email validation.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` (12/5/2025, 2:05 PM - 12/8/2025, 10:44 PM):**
    *   A new Eloquent model was introduced for PlotBox data sourced from Snowflake (`const CONNECTION = 'snowflake'`).
    *   The `getDataWithDateRange` static method was heavily developed, starting with a query for primary/deceased contacts. It was enhanced to include a `product_counts` Common Table Expression (CTE) and joined to retrieve detailed product quantities (caskets, cremation, etc.).
    *   Debugging-related `LIMIT` clauses and specific `WHERE` clauses were added and removed repeatedly. A temporary `getDataWithDateRange1` method was used during development and later removed.
    *   By the last entry, the `product_counts` CTE and its join were integrated into `getDataWithDateRange`, and a `testSimpleQuery` method was properly implemented for connection validation.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php` (12/5/2025, 3:40 PM - 3:41 PM):** A new mapper specifically for PlotBox data was introduced. It defines `mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, and `mapDeal` methods, which map PlotBox-specific fields, including the new detailed product count fields, to HubSpot properties. It also contains logic for generating deal names and extracting owner emails from JSON data.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` (12/5/2025, 2:06 PM - 12/8/2025, 10:28 PM):** This new service was introduced to orchestrate the PlotBox data sync. It fetches data via `HubSpotRepositoryInterface`, uses `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`, and interacts with HubSpot services. Early versions contained `dd()` and `var_dump()` statements for debugging, which were progressively removed. It also temporarily skipped 'SHIPOUT' processing, and then the related code was removed, indicating it's not handled by this service.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Console\Commands\Integration\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand.php` (12/8/2025, 10:13 PM - 10:28 PM):** A new console command was added to manage the PlotBox to HubSpot sync process. It allows for flexible date-based filtering, logs the sync status, and sends email notifications upon errors. Debugging output (`var_dump`) was removed from the error handling.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Multi-Source Data Integration:** The most prominent pattern is the expansion from a single HMIS data source to accommodate a new PlotBox data source, requiring new DTOs, mappers, services, and repository logic (`EloquentHubSpotRepository` refactoring).
2.  **Modular Architecture:** The codebase consistently uses a modular design with dedicated service classes, mappers, repositories, and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for clear separation of concerns.
3.  **Iterative Development and Debugging:** Frequent additions and removals of debugging statements (`dd()`, `var_dump()`) and temporary code (e.g., `limit` clauses in SQL, hardcoded owner emails, `getDataWithDateRange1` method) across multiple files indicate an active, iterative development process with focused testing.
4.  **Date-Based Synchronization:** Both HMIS and PlotBox integrations support date-filtered data synchronization, suggesting a pattern of incremental updates to HubSpot.
5.  **Robust Error Handling and Logging:** Services and commands incorporate `try-catch` blocks with detailed error logging using `Log::error` and email notifications for critical failures, ensuring resilience and visibility into integration issues.
6.  **Data Transformation and Standardization:** Mappers are crucial for transforming source system data into a HubSpot-compatible format, involving trimming, case conversion, and date formatting. The `EloquentHubSpotRepository` also includes a `transformKeysToTitleCase` helper for consistent data object key naming.
7.  **Product-Level Detail for PlotBox:** The PlotBox integration specifically captures and maps detailed product counts (e.g., caskets, cremation products, ground spaces) to HubSpot deals, indicating a requirement to track granular product/service information not explicitly seen in the HMIS context.
