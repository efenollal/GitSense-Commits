# Activity Summary for 11/12/2025

## 10:22:39 AM
The log details a series of changes primarily focused on integrating "PlotBox" data with HubSpot CRM, involving significant refinement of data retrieval, transformation, and mapping logic.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Repositories\EloquentHubSpotRepository.php`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Updates span from 11/7/2025, 1:03:43 PM to 11/7/2025, 3:44:06 PM, indicating intensive development and debugging over a few hours.
    *   **Initial changes (1:22 PM):** Introduced `App\Data\PlotBoxDataTransferObject` and a `transformKeysToTitleCase` method to standardize data keys (e.g., `DECEASED_FIRST_NAME` to `Deceased_First_Name`). The `getDataForCrmSync` method was modified to use `PlotBoxDataTransferObject`.
    *   **Conditional Logic (1:27 PM):** Added an `if (str_contains($this->modelClass, 'PlotBox'))` block in `getDataForCrmSync` to conditionally map data to either `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` (for PlotBox models) or `HubSpotDataTransferObject` (for other models), initially attempting a `fromDatabase` static constructor for `PlotBoxDataTransferObject`.
    *   **Debugging (1:36 PM - 2:22 PM):** Frequent insertion and removal of `dd()` (dump and die) and `var_dump(); exit;` statements, along with commented-out code blocks, denote active troubleshooting of data transformation and DTO instantiation.
    *   **Robust Mapping (2:27 PM):** The DTO constructors were updated to use null coalescing (`?? null`) for properties, making them more resilient to missing data. The `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` mapping initially reverted from `fromDatabase` to direct construction (`new PlotBoxDataTransferObject($item)`), then to explicit property mapping.
    *   **Schema Alignment (3:18 PM - 3:44 PM):** `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` mapping in `getDataForCrmSync` was extended to include `Gender`, `Marital_Status`, `County`, `Contract_Owner_Id`, and `Primary_Account_Number` fields, reflecting evolving data requirements or source schema.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Changes occurred between 11/7/2025, 1:50:13 PM and 11/7/2025, 1:58:45 PM.
    *   **Variable Renaming (1:50 PM):** `$this->dataToSync` was renamed to `$this->plotBoxData` for clarity.
    *   **Debugging (1:52 PM - 1:58 PM):** A `dd($this->plotBoxData)` was added, and the core processing `foreach` loop within `syncPlotBoxData` was temporarily commented out, indicating a focus on verifying the initial data fetch.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Updates were recorded between 11/7/2025, 1:55:10 PM and 11/7/2025, 1:56:07 PM.
    *   **Robustness (1:55 PM - 1:56 PM):** `if (empty($hubspotDto)) { return []; }` checks were added to `mapDeceasedContact` and `mapDeal` methods to prevent errors when mapping empty data transfer objects.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Console\Commands\Integration\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand.php`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Changes were very brief, from 11/7/2025, 2:00:23 PM to 11/7/2025, 2:02:02 PM.
    *   **Debugging (2:02 PM):** The `sendErrorNotification` call in the `catch` block was replaced with `dd($e->getMessage())`, temporarily disabling error notifications for immediate exception inspection.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Data\HubSpotDataTransferObject.php`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Edits were made between 11/7/2025, 2:11:59 PM and 11/7/2025, 2:24:56 PM.
    *   **Debugging (2:11 PM):** A `dd($uniqueKey)` was inserted into the constructor.
    *   **Nullability (2:24 PM):** Many `public string` properties were changed to `public ?string`, allowing more flexibility for nullable data. The debug statement was subsequently removed.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Data\PlotBoxDataTransferObject.php`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Changes occurred from 11/7/2025, 2:28:04 PM to 11/7/2025, 3:25:29 PM.
    *   **Static Constructor (2:28 PM):** A `static function fromDatabase($data)` was initially introduced to construct the DTO from database results, handling both snake_case and Upper_Snake_Case column names.
    *   **Debugging/Reversion (2:31 PM - 2:38 PM):** The `fromDatabase` method was temporarily broken (malformed code), debugged with `dd($data)`, and then fully removed/reverted.
    *   **New Properties (3:19 PM - 3:25 PM):** `gender` and `maritalStatus` properties were added to the DTO and its constructor.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **Timestamps:** This file saw the most extensive and complex changes, spanning from 11/7/2025, 4:07:02 PM to 11/12/2025, 9:22:48 AM.
    *   **Initial Data Fetch (4:07 PM):** Defined `getDataWithDateRange` and `getDataWithDateRange1` (using CTEs) for Snowflake. `getDataForCrmSync` mapped raw data to `PlotBoxDataTransferObject::fromDatabase`.
    *   **SQL Refinement and Bugs (4:07 PM - 4:25 PM):** Numerous small adjustments, including adding `ORDER BY` clauses, fixing SQL syntax errors (e.g., in `BETWEEN` clause), and attempts to filter for `is_deceased` status within different CTEs.
    *   **Refactoring to Query Builder (11/10/2025, 3:12 PM):** A major change was an attempt to rewrite the `getDataWithDateRange` method from raw SQL CTEs to Laravel's fluent query builder syntax to fetch living contacts, then deceased contacts, and merge them. This included error handling.
    *   **Reversion to Raw SQL (11/10/2025, 3:28 PM):** The query builder approach was reverted back to the complex raw SQL CTE query, suggesting issues with the ORM/DBAL layer on Snowflake for such complex operations.
    *   **Simplification (11/10/2025, 3:43 PM):** Eloquent-specific features like scopes, accessors, and relationship methods were removed, streamlining the model to primarily raw SQL data retrieval. `protected $dates` was also removed.
    *   **SQL Detail Refinements (11/11/2025, 10:45 PM - 11/12/2025, 12:00 AM):** The raw SQL `getDataWithDateRange` continued to be refined, changing column aliases (`PRIMARY_CONTACT_ID`), adding and modifying selection of `CONTRACT_OWNERS_JSON` and parsing `Deal_Owner_Email` from it (initially from a direct `email_address` property, then from the `[0]` element of the JSON array). The date filter was moved from the outer `WHERE` to the `base_contracts` CTE for better performance. A `COALESCE` function was introduced for `Account_Nbr`.
    *   **Prepared Statements vs. Interpolation (11/12/2025, 12:03 AM - 12:06 AM):** A brief attempt to use secure prepared statements with named parameters (`:fromDate`, `:toDate`) was made, but quickly reverted to less secure string interpolation for dates, possibly due to compatibility or driver issues.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HubSpot Integration Focus:** The entire log revolves around data synchronization between an internal system (HMIS/PlotBox) and HubSpot CRM.
*   **Data Transformation:** A consistent pattern is the need to transform data, particularly standardizing database column names (e.g., `snake_case` to `Title_Case_With_Underscores`) before mapping to DTOs.
*   **Debugging-Heavy Development:** The frequent addition, modification, and removal of `dd()` and `var_dump()` statements across multiple files highlight an iterative, debug-driven development process.
*   **PlotBox Specifics:** The integration explicitly handles "PlotBox" data, introducing dedicated DTOs, service logic, and complex database queries optimized for Snowflake.
*   **Snowflake Query Challenges:** The `PlotBox\Contact` model demonstrates ongoing struggles with complex SQL queries against a Snowflake database, oscillating between raw SQL with CTEs, a brief attempt at Laravel's query builder, and subqueries, eventually returning to raw CTEs with specific syntax for JSON parsing and robust field selection.
*   **Null Safety:** The introduction of null coalescing (`?? null`) in DTO constructors reflects an effort to handle potentially missing data gracefully.
*   **Date-Based Sync:** All data fetching mechanisms incorporate date filtering, supporting single dates, date ranges, and a number of days back for incremental synchronization.

## 11:22:30 AM
The project primarily focuses on syncing PlotBox data, and potentially HMIS data, to HubSpot CRM, undergoing significant refactoring, debugging, and feature additions across several PHP files.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Repositories\EloquentHubSpotRepository.php`**
    *   **Initial State (11/7/2025, 1:03 PM - 1:04 PM)**: Focused on mapping HMIS data to `HubSpotDataTransferObject`.
    *   **Introduction of PlotBox Logic (11/7/2025, 1:22 PM)**: A `transformKeysToTitleCase` helper was added. The repository was adapted to handle both PlotBox and HMIS data through conditional logic (`str_contains($this->modelClass, 'PlotBox')`) within the `getDataForCrmSync` method. Initially, `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` mapping was also introduced.
    *   **Intensive Debugging (11/7/2025, 1:36 PM - 2:22 PM)**: Multiple `dd()` and `var_dump()` debugging statements were frequently inserted and removed throughout the `getDataForCrmSync` method and within DTO constructor calls, indicating active troubleshooting of data retrieval and transformation.
    *   **Refinement and Robustness (11/7/2025, 2:27 PM)**: Debugging calls were cleaned up. `PlotBoxDataTransferObject::fromDatabase($item)` (a static constructor) was briefly introduced for PlotBox data mapping, then reverted to direct constructor usage `new PlotBoxDataTransferObject($item)` later in the day (11/7/2025, 2:34 PM). Null coalescing (`?? null`) was widely adopted in `HubSpotDataTransferObject` constructor calls for handling missing data gracefully.
    *   **Schema Expansion (11/7/2025, 3:18 PM - 3:44 PM)**: New fields like `Gender`, `Marital_Status`, `County`, `Contract_Owner_Id`, and `Primary_Account_Number` were progressively added to the `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` mapping arguments.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **Initial Setup (11/7/2025, 1:50 PM)**: Configured to use `EloquentHubSpotRepository` with `\App\Models\PlotBox\Contact::class` and orchestrates mapping PlotBox data to HubSpot contacts and deals, distinguishing between "SHIPOUT" and regular records.
    *   **Debugging (11/7/2025, 1:52 PM - 1:58 PM)**: `dd($this->plotBoxData)` was introduced to inspect fetched data, and the primary data processing loop was temporarily commented out, indicating debugging of the data retrieval step.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   **Comprehensive Mapping (11/7/2025, 1:55 PM)**: Contains logic to map both generic `HubSpotDataTransferObject` and specific `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` to HubSpot CRM format. It includes a `formatMappedFields` helper for data standardization (e.g., location IDs, state capitalization, owner lookup).
    *   **Improved Robustness (11/7/2025, 1:55 PM - 1:56 PM)**: Added early `empty()` checks to `mapDeceasedContact` and `mapDeal` methods to prevent errors with null input DTOs.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Console\Commands\Integration\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand.php`**
    *   **Command Definition (11/7/2025, 2:00 PM)**: Defines a console command (`hub:plotbox-hubspot-data-push`) supporting date filtering options (`--date`, `--from-date`, `--to-date`, `--days-back`) to trigger the sync.
    *   **Debugging Focus (11/7/2025, 2:02 PM)**: Error notification logic was commented out, and a `dd()` statement was placed directly in the catch block for immediate exception inspection during command execution.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Data\HubSpotDataTransferObject.php`**
    *   **DTO Definition (11/7/2025, 2:11 PM)**: Defines the DTO with many properties for HubSpot data.
    *   **Schema Adjustments and Debugging (11/7/2025, 2:24 PM - 2:24 PM)**: Some properties were made nullable, and a `dd()` call in the constructor was removed after debugging.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Data\PlotBoxDataTransferObject.php`**
    *   **DTO with Factory Method (11/7/2025, 2:28 PM)**: Defines a DTO for PlotBox data, notably including a `fromDatabase($data)` static factory method for safe instantiation from raw data. Also includes helper methods for full names and email validation.
    *   **Debugging and Expansion (11/7/2025, 2:31 PM - 3:25 PM)**: The `fromDatabase` method was debugged (including a syntax error and `dd()` statements) and later corrected. New fields like `gender` and `maritalStatus` were added to the DTO's properties and constructor.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **Model and Query Definitions (11/7/2025, 4:07 PM)**: Eloquent model for Snowflake, defining relationships, scopes, and key data retrieval methods like `getDataForCrmSync` and `getDataWithDateRange`. `getDataWithDateRange` initially used a simpler SQL query.
    *   **Query Evolution (11/7/2025, 4:11 PM - 4:31 PM)**: `getDataWithDateRange` underwent several changes, initially fixing incorrect SQL `BETWEEN` syntax (11/7/2025, 4:11 PM). It was then completely replaced with a more complex CTE-based raw SQL query to fetch both primary and deceased contacts (11/7/2025, 4:13 PM). Filters for `is_deceased` were added (11/7/2025, 4:20 PM - 4:28 PM), and then aliases were refined.
    *   **Major Query Refactoring (11/10/2025, 3:12 PM - 3:28 PM)**: The `getDataWithDateRange` method was dramatically refactored. It was temporarily rewritten using Laravel's query builder with separate queries for living and deceased contacts, then reverted, and finally settled on a single raw SQL query using CTEs.
    *   **Data Sourcing and Security (11/10/2025, 3:10 PM - 11/12/2025, 12:03 AM)**: The `Location_Cd` source was changed from `CONTRACT_SALE_LOCATION` to be derived from `pc.CONTACT_KEY` (11/10/2025, 3:10 PM). Parameter binding (`?`, `:fromDate`, `:toDate`) for date filters was introduced for security (11/11/2025, 11:56 PM; 11/12/2025, 12:03 AM) but then reverted back to string concatenation (11/12/2025, 12:06 AM).
    *   **JSON Parsing (11/11/2025, 11:05 PM - 11:53 PM)**: Support for extracting `Deal_Owner_Email` from a `CONTRACT_OWNERS_JSON` column using `PARSE_JSON` was added, explicitly targeting the first element of a JSON array.
    *   **Unified Account Number (11/12/2025, 12:00 AM)**: A `COALESCE` function was added to select either the deceased contact ID or the primary contact ID as a unified `Account_Nbr`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **HubSpot Integration**: All changes directly relate to fetching, transforming, or syncing data to HubSpot CRM, using dedicated DTOs and services.
2.  **Dual Data Sources**: The application manages data from at least two sources (HMIS and PlotBox), necessitating conditional logic and distinct data models/mappers.
3.  **Extensive Debugging**: Frequent use of `dd()`, `var_dump()`, and commenting out code sections indicates an iterative and debugging-heavy development process, particularly in the early stages of data pipeline implementation.
4.  **Schema Evolution**: Continuous additions of new fields (e.g., `Gender`, `Marital_Status`, `County`, JSON-derived owner emails) to DTOs and database queries reflect an evolving data model and increased data requirements for CRM synchronization.
5.  **Complex Raw SQL**: `PlotBox\Contact.php` heavily relies on intricate raw SQL queries against a Snowflake database, often using CTEs to combine related data (primary contacts, deceased contacts, contract details). These queries are regularly refined for data extraction and performance.
6.  **Data Transformation and Standardization**: A `transformKeysToTitleCase` function standardizes data keys, and mapping logic explicitly trims and formats fields to ensure compatibility with HubSpot's expected data structure.
7.  **Robustness Improvements**: Additions of `empty()` checks and null coalescing operators (`?? null`) aim to make the data processing more resilient to incomplete or missing source data.
8.  **Query Security Concerns**: While parameter binding was attempted for SQL queries, there were instances of reverting to less secure string concatenation, which is a recurring pattern of concern.

## 12:22:40 PM
The changes log details an active development phase focused on integrating PlotBox data with HubSpot CRM, primarily involving data retrieval, transformation, and mapping components within a PHP Laravel application.

### File-Specific Updates:

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Repositories\EloquentHubSpotRepository.php`**
*   **Initial Focus (11/7/2025, 1:03 PM):** The repository began by fetching HMIS (HubSpot Marketing Information System) data and mapping it directly to `HubSpotDataTransferObject`. Frequent `dd()` (dump and die) statements were present in the DTO constructor, indicating early-stage debugging.
*   **Introduction of PlotBox (11/7/2025, 1:22 PM):** A significant shift occurred with the introduction of `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` and a `transformKeysToTitleCase` utility. Initially, the `getDataForCrmSync` method was modified to *always* map to `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` after applying key transformations.
*   **Conditional Mapping & Refinement (11/7/2025, 1:27 PM - 2:27 PM):** The `getDataForCrmSync` method was refactored to conditionally map data based on the `modelClass` property. If the model related to 'PlotBox', it would use `PlotBoxDataTransferObject`; otherwise, it would use `HubSpotDataTransferObject`. This included several debugging insertions (`dd($model)`, `dd($hubspotData)`, `var_dump($item)`) and their subsequent removals or corrections.
*   **Robust DTO Instantiation (11/7/2025, 2:27 PM):** A major improvement was made in the HMIS branch, where `HubSpotDataTransferObject` constructor arguments were updated to use the null coalescing operator (`?? null`) for all fields, making data instantiation more resilient to missing source data. For PlotBox, it began calling a static factory method `PlotBoxDataTransferObject::fromDatabase($item)`.
*   **PlotBox Data Fields (11/7/2025, 3:18 PM - 3:44 PM):** Subsequent changes specifically updated the `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` instantiation, adding and refining field mappings such as `Gender`, `Marital_Status`, `County`, and renaming owner/account related fields from `Deal_Owner_User_Name` to `Contract_Owner_Id` and `Account_Nbr` to `Primary_Account_Number`.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
*   **Core Sync Logic (11/7/2025, 1:50 PM):** This service was introduced to orchestrate the PlotBox to HubSpot sync. It utilizes `EloquentHubSpotRepository` (specifically for `PlotBox\Contact` model) to fetch data, then maps it into primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals, distinguishing between 'SHIPOUT' and other service types.
*   **Debugging (11/7/2025, 1:52 PM - 1:58 PM):** Debugging was observed with `dd($this->plotBoxData)` and large sections of the processing `foreach` loop being commented out, indicating active testing of the data fetching stage.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
*   **New Mapper (11/7/2025, 1:55 PM):** This file was introduced to handle the complex mapping logic for PlotBox data into HubSpot-specific contact and deal formats. It includes methods like `mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, `mapDeal` (for HMIS data) and a comprehensive `mapPlotBoxToHubSpot` method for PlotBox data, along with helper methods for owner mapping, deal name generation, and field formatting.
*   **Robustness (11/7/2025, 1:55 PM - 1:56 PM):** Checks for empty DTOs were added to `mapDeceasedContact` and `mapDeal` for better error handling.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Console\Commands\Integration\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand.php`**
*   **Command Definition (11/7/2025, 2:00 PM):** This console command was set up to trigger the PlotBox-HubSpot sync, supporting various date filtering options. It logs the sync process and sends error notifications.
*   **Debugging (11/7/2025, 2:02 PM):** Error notification logic was temporarily commented out in favor of `dd($e->getMessage())` for immediate debugging feedback.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Data\HubSpotDataTransferObject.php`**
*   **Nullability & Debugging (11/7/2025, 2:11 PM - 2:24 PM):** Properties were updated to be explicitly nullable (`?string`), improving type safety. A `dd($uniqueKey)` statement was present in the constructor, then removed.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Data\PlotBoxDataTransferObject.php`**
*   **Initial Design & Debugging (11/7/2025, 2:28 PM):** Introduced as a DTO specific to PlotBox data. It included a static `fromDatabase` method, which was initially commented out with a `dd($data)` statement.
*   **Property Additions (11/7/2025, 3:19 PM - 3:25 PM):** New properties `gender` and `maritalStatus` were added to support additional PlotBox data fields.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
*   **Data Retrieval Evolution (11/7/2025, 4:07 PM - 11/12/2025, 9:22 AM):** This file shows the most dynamic changes, focusing on querying the Snowflake database.
    *   It started with two distinct raw SQL `getDataWithDateRange` methods: a complex CTE-based one and a simpler one (with limited functionality).
    *   There were several attempts to refine the `getDataWithDateRange` to include both living and deceased contacts, including:
        *   Shifting between CTE-based and correlated subquery approaches for fetching associated deceased contacts.
        *   An attempt to use Laravel's fluent Query Builder, which was later reverted.
        *   Continuous refinement of `SELECT` lists and `WHERE` clauses to correctly extract and alias fields like `Location_Cd` (derived from `CONTACT_KEY`) and `Deal_Owner_Email` (parsed from a `CONTRACT_OWNERS_JSON` field).
        *   Introduction of `PRIMARY_CONTACT_ID` alias and `COALESCE` for `Account_Nbr`.
        *   Fluctuations in SQL parameterization, moving from direct string interpolation to positional `?` placeholders, then to named parameters (`:fromDate`), and finally back to direct string interpolation for date ranges in the `getDataWithDateRange` method. This indicates ongoing struggles with database driver compatibility or preference for raw SQL string building.
    *   Multiple `LIMIT 5` or `LIMIT 10` clauses were consistently applied in the SQL queries, suggesting that only a small subset of data is being fetched, likely for testing or development purposes.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/7/2025, 1:22 PM:** `EloquentHubSpotRepository.php` first introduced PlotBox concepts (`PlotBoxDataTransferObject`, `transformKeysToTitleCase`).
*   **11/7/2025, 1:27 PM:** `EloquentHubSpotRepository.php` adopted conditional logic for mapping different DTOs (HMIS vs. PlotBox).
*   **11/7/2025, 1:55 PM:** `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php` was created, centralizing PlotBox-specific mapping logic.
*   **11/7/2025, 2:27 PM:** `EloquentHubSpotRepository.php` refined its DTO instantiation to be more robust with null coalescing and introduced `PlotBoxDataTransferObject::fromDatabase()`.
*   **11/7/2025, 4:07 PM:** `PlotBox\Contact.php` model was introduced, outlining the complex Snowflake query for data extraction.
*   **11/10/2025, 3:12 PM - 3:33 PM:** `PlotBox\Contact.php` underwent major, rapid revisions in its `getDataWithDateRange` method, switching between Query Builder and raw SQL CTE/subquery implementations.
*   **11/11/2025, 11:56 PM & 11/12/2025, 12:03 AM & 11/12/2025, 12:06 AM:** `PlotBox\Contact.php` shows repeated changes related to SQL query parameterization and date filtering within the raw SQL statements.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Debugging:** Frequent insertion and removal of `dd()` and `var_dump()` statements indicate an iterative development and testing process across multiple files.
*   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** Extensive use of DTOs (`HubSpotDataTransferObject`, `PlotBoxDataTransferObject`) to structure and manage data between layers, often with nullable properties and null coalescing for robustness.
*   **Data Transformation:** The `transformKeysToTitleCase` utility and explicit field mapping in DTO constructors and mappers highlight the need to standardize data coming from heterogeneous sources (HMIS vs. PlotBox) for HubSpot.
*   **Database Query Complexity:** The `PlotBox\Contact.php` file demonstrates persistent challenges and iterative refinement in constructing complex raw SQL queries for Snowflake, particularly in joining different contact types (primary/living vs. deceased) and extracting specific nested data (e.g., from JSON fields for `Deal_Owner_Email`). The changes show a back-and-forth between different SQL structures (CTEs, subqueries) and concerns about database driver compatibility (ODBC cursor issues).
*   **HubSpot Integration:** All changes are geared towards populating HubSpot CRM with contact and deal information from external data sources.
*   **Date Filtering:** The console command and repository methods consistently support flexible date range filtering for data synchronization.

## 1:22:08 PM
The provided log details a series of code changes primarily focused on integrating "PlotBox" data into a HubSpot synchronization process, along with general improvements to data handling and querying. The changes occurred between November 7, 2025, and November 12, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Repositories\EloquentHubSpotRepository.php`**
    *   **11/7/2025, 1:03 PM - 1:04 PM:** Initial state and minor identical change, primarily focused on mapping data from a model to a `HubSpotDataTransferObject` with a long list of properties. `dd($item)` was present for debugging.
    *   **11/7/2025, 1:22 PM:** Introduction of `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` and a new private method `transformKeysToTitleCase`. The `getDataForCrmSync` method was modified to use `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` and include `dd($item)` again for debugging.
    *   **11/7/2025, 1:22 PM:** The `transformKeysToTitleCase` method was integrated into `getDataForCrmSync` to map data keys to a title-case format before creating the DTO.
    *   **11/7/2025, 1:27 PM - 1:29 PM:** Conditional logic was added to `getDataForCrmSync` to dynamically choose between `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` and `HubSpotDataTransferObject` based on whether the `$modelClass` contains 'PlotBox'. This introduced a branch for PlotBox-specific data handling.
    *   **11/7/2025, 1:36 PM - 1:43 PM:** Debugging `dd($model)` and `dd($hubspotData)` were added and then removed, indicating iterative testing of data retrieval and transformation.
    *   **11/7/2025, 1:43 PM:** The `dd($item)` inside the `HubSpotDataTransferObject` constructor call was removed, suggesting debugging completion for that specific line.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:20 PM - 2:22 PM:** Further debugging calls (`dd($data)`, `var_dump($data)`, `var_dump($item)`) were added and quickly removed or commented out from the `HubSpotDataTransferObject` mapping, indicating a focused effort to inspect data before DTO creation.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:22 PM:** The individual properties passed to `HubSpotDataTransferObject` constructor were commented out after a `var_dump($item)` call, suggesting a test or refactoring was interrupted.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:22 PM:** The commented-out properties were re-added.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:27 PM:** The mapping logic within `getDataForCrmSync` was significantly refined. It now explicitly uses `PlotBoxDataTransferObject::fromDatabase($item)` for PlotBox models and individually mapped properties with null coalescing (`?? null`) for `HubSpotDataTransferObject`. This implies the `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` gained a static factory method.
    *   **11/7/2025, 3:18 PM - 3:44 PM:** New fields like `County`, `Gender`, `Marital_Status`, and `Contract_Owner_Id` were added to the `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` constructor call, and `Primary_Account_Number` was added for PlotBox, replacing `Account_Nbr`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **11/7/2025, 1:50 PM:** The property `$this->dataToSync` was renamed to `$this->plotBoxData`.
    *   **11/7/2025, 1:52 PM:** A `dd($this->plotBoxData)` call was inserted and then commented out, along with the entire `foreach` loop that processes the data, likely for debugging the raw fetched PlotBox data. The core processing logic was temporarily disabled.
    *   **11/7/2025, 1:58 PM:** The commented-out `foreach` loop was partially restored, still with `dd($this->plotBoxData)` at the top, indicating a continued debugging phase before the loop.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   **11/7/2025, 1:55 PM - 1:56 PM:** Null checks `if (empty($hubspotDto)) { return []; }` were added to `mapDeceasedContact` and `mapDeal` methods for robustness.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Console\Commands\Integration\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand.php`**
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:00 PM:** The command's descriptive text and error messages were updated to refer to "PlotBox HubSpot" instead of "HMIS HubSpot". A `dd($e->getMessage())` was temporarily added to the error notification handling.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:02 PM:** The `dd($e->getMessage())` was removed/commented out from the error handling, suggesting the error notification mechanism was functional or moved past that specific debugging point.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Data\HubSpotDataTransferObject.php`**
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:11 PM:** A `dd($uniqueKey)` call was added inside the constructor for debugging.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:24 PM:** All public properties were explicitly made nullable (`?string`), and the `dd($uniqueKey)` was still present.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:24 PM:** The `dd($uniqueKey)` call was finally removed.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Data\PlotBoxDataTransferObject.php`**
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:28 PM:** A static factory method `fromDatabase` was introduced, taking `$data` and constructing a `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` using named arguments with null coalescing for many fields.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:31 PM:** The `fromDatabase` method's implementation was severely broken, incorrectly containing constructor assignments, which was promptly fixed.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:32 PM:** A `dd($data)` was added to the `fromDatabase` method, and the actual constructor calls were commented out, again for debugging the input data.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:38 PM:** The `dd($data)` was removed, and the `fromDatabase` method was restored to its intended functionality, likely resolving the previous debugging phase.
    *   **11/7/2025, 3:19 PM:** The `gender` property was added, and its initialization in the constructor was added.
    *   **11/7/2025, 3:25 PM:** The `maritalStatus` property was added, and its initialization in the constructor was added.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **11/7/2025, 4:07 PM:** Substantial refactoring of data retrieval. The `getDataWithDateRange` method was split into `getDataWithDateRange` (new, simpler Eloquent-style query without CTEs to avoid ODBC cursor issues, but actually using raw SQL) and `getDataWithDateRange1` (retaining the more complex CTE-based raw SQL query). Initial queries were simplified to fetch only primary contacts.
    *   **11/7/2025, 4:07 PM - 4:10 PM:** The raw SQL in `getDataWithDateRange` (the simpler one) was updated to explicitly `ORDER BY dc.CONTACT_KEY` and `LIMIT 5`.
    *   **11/7/2025, 4:11 PM:** The `WHERE` clause in the simpler `getDataWithDateRange` was incorrectly changed to `BETWEEN ('{$fromDate}', {$toDate})` which is invalid SQL syntax.
    *   **11/7/2025, 4:12 PM:** The invalid `BETWEEN` syntax was corrected to `BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}'`.
    *   **11/7/2025, 4:13 PM:** The method `getDataWithDateRange1` (the CTE-based query) was made the primary `getDataWithDateRange` method, suggesting the simpler query was insufficient. The CTE-based query returned `PRIMARY_CONTACT_ID` and `Deceased_Is_Deceased` fields.
    *   **11/7/2025, 4:20 PM - 4:25 PM:** The CTE-based `getDataWithDateRange` method was modified multiple times, specifically in the `WHERE` clause, changing `pc.is_deceased = TRUE` to `dc.IS_DECEASED = 1` and `dc.Is_Deceased = 1`. This indicates struggles with correctly filtering for deceased contacts within the complex CTE structure.
    *   **11/7/2025, 4:28 PM:** The CTEs were updated to include `dc.IS_DECEASED` as `is_deceased` and `deceased_is_deceased` in both `primary_contacts` and `deceased_contacts` to make the `IS_DECEASED` flags available in the final `SELECT`. The `WHERE` clause filtering was also adjusted to remove the `IS_DECEASED` check from the final `WHERE` clause, as it should be handled in the CTEs.
    *   **11/10/2025, 3:05 PM:** The `PRIMARY_CONTACT_ID` alias was added to the `primary_contacts` CTE. The `LEAD_OWNER` field was added to the `primary_contacts` CTE `SELECT` list.
    *   **11/10/2025, 3:10 PM:** The `location_cd` in the `SELECT` clause of `getDataWithDateRange1` (the complex raw SQL method) was changed to derive from `SUBSTRING(CAST(pc.CONTACT_KEY AS STRING), 1, 3)`.
    *   **11/10/2025, 3:18 PM:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method was entirely re-written to use Laravel's query builder for `livingContacts` and then a separate raw SQL query for `deceasedContacts` using an `IN` clause with placeholders, followed by merging the results. This was done to address potential ODBC cursor issues with complex CTEs in Snowflake. The previous complex raw SQL was moved to `getDataWithDateRang1`.
    *   **11/10/2025, 3:23 PM:** The query was further refined to handle `contractKeys` potentially being empty before fetching `deceasedContacts`. A missing closing brace was added, and a duplicate `getHubspotData` method was commented out.
    *   **11/10/2025, 3:28 PM:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method (the one using Eloquent's query builder and raw SQL for deceased) was commented out, and the original CTE-based raw SQL query was restored to `getDataWithDateRange`. This indicates a reversion to the CTE approach, possibly due to issues with the mixed Eloquent/raw SQL approach or in debugging it. This version added proper parameter binding using `?` for `WHERE CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN ? AND ?`.
    *   **11/10/2025, 3:34 PM:** The table name for `DIM_CONTACT` was corrected to remove an extra space.
    *   **11/10/2025, 3:38 PM:** The `Location_Cd` in the final `SELECT` statement of `getDataWithDateRange` was changed to `SUBSTRING(CAST(pc.CONTACT_KEY AS STRING), 1, 3)`.
    *   **11/11/2025, 10:45 PM:** `PRIMARY_CONTACT_ID` was added to `primary_contacts` CTE.
    *   **11/11/2025, 11:05 PM:** `CONTRACT_OWNER_JSON` was added to both `base_contracts` and `primary_contacts` CTEs.
    *   **11/11/2025, 11:15 PM:** `LEAD_OWNER` was removed from the `primary_contacts` CTE, suggesting it's no longer used or is retrieved differently.
    *   **11/11/2025, 11:19 PM:** `LEAD_OWNER` was re-added to the `primary_contacts` CTE, indicating it was indeed needed.
    *   **11/11/2025, 11:26 PM:** `LEAD_OWNER` was again removed from the final `SELECT` list, but `bc.CONTRACT_SALE_LOCATION` was used directly in the `primary_contacts` CTE. The `Deal_Owner_User_Name` from `primary_contacts` was removed, but it's still present in the `base_contracts` CTE. This might indicate an intention to derive it from `CONTRACT_OWNERS_JSON` directly.
    *   **11/11/2025, 11:30 PM:** `bc.CONTRACT_SALE_LOCATION` was removed from `primary_contacts` CTE (it was `bc.LEAD_OWNER` in previous commits, now it's `bc.CONTRACT_OWNERS_JSON`).
    *   **11/11/2025, 11:35 PM:** `Contract_Owners_Json` was explicitly added to the final `SELECT` statement, and `Deal_Owner_Email` was extracted from this JSON using `PARSE_JSON(pc.CONTRACT_OWNERS_JSON):email_address::STRING`.
    *   **11/11/2025, 11:42 PM - 11:58 PM:** `Deal_Owner_Email` extraction was refined from `PARSE_JSON(pc.CONTRACT_OWNERS_JSON):email_address::STRING` to `PARSE_JSON(pc.CONTRACT_OWNERS_JSON)[0]:email_address::STRING`, implying `CONTRACT_OWNERS_JSON` is an array.
    *   **11/12/2025, 12:00 AM:** A `Account_Nbr` field was added to the final `SELECT` statement using `COALESCE(dc.deceased_contact_id, pc.PRIMARY_CONTACT_ID)`.
    *   **11/12/2025, 12:03 AM - 12:06 AM:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method was refactored to use named parameters (`:fromDate`, `:toDate`) in the raw SQL query, replacing the string interpolation (`{$fromDate}`).
    *   **11/12/2025, 9:22 AM:** The named parameters were reverted to string interpolation. This might suggest compatibility issues or preference for the simpler string interpolation in this context.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **PlotBox Integration:** A major theme is the integration of "PlotBox" data, including dedicated DTOs (`PlotBoxDataTransferObject`), model methods (`PlotBox\Contact::getDataWithDateRange`), and service logic (`PlotBoxHubSpotService`). This suggests a new data source or system is being incorporated.
2.  **Data Transformation:** The `transformKeysToTitleCase` method and the logic within DTO constructors indicate a consistent effort to standardize data keys and format them for HubSpot.
3.  **Debugging Practices:** Frequent insertion and removal/commenting out of `dd()` and `var_dump()` calls are evident across multiple files, signaling an active and iterative debugging process.
4.  **Database Query Refinement (Snowflake):** The `PlotBox\Contact` model shows a significant evolution in its `getDataWithDateRange` method. It progresses from simple SQL to complex CTEs, then attempts with mixed Eloquent/raw SQL, and finally settles on a refined CTE-based raw SQL query with a focus on resolving potential ODBC cursor issues and ensuring correct data fetching (especially for primary and deceased contacts related to a contract). This implies challenges working with the Snowflake database driver and complex queries.
5.  **Null Safety:** The widespread use of the null coalescing operator (`?? null`) in DTO constructors and data mapping highlights an emphasis on handling potentially missing or null data gracefully.
6.  **Code Consistency:** Changes in `PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand` from "HMIS" to "PlotBox" in messages and logs indicate a renaming or clear distinction of the data source being processed.

## 2:22:38 PM
The log details a series of changes primarily focused on integrating PlotBox data into HubSpot CRM, alongside existing HMIS data. The updates span several PHP files related to data repositories, mappers, DTOs, and a console command, indicating an active development and debugging cycle.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Repositories\EloquentHubSpotRepository.php`**
    *   **11/7/2025, 1:22:01 PM:** Introduced `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` and a new private method `transformKeysToTitleCase` to convert data keys from `snake_case` to `Title_Case_With_Underscores`. The `getDataForCrmSync` method was modified to conditionally use `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` mapping.
    *   **11/7/2025, 1:27:07 PM - 1:43:28 PM:** Conditional logic for processing 'PlotBox' specific models was added and refined within `getDataForCrmSync`, initially using a `fromDatabase` static method on `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` (briefly), then reverting to direct constructor calls.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:27:13 PM:** The conditional logic for PlotBox data was firmly re-established, with PlotBox data being mapped to `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` (using a non-existent `fromDatabase` method at this point, indicating a potential API change) and other data to `HubSpotDataTransferObject`. Null coalescing (`?? null`) was extensively added to property assignments in DTO constructors for robustness.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:38:01 PM - 3:44:06 PM:** PlotBox data mapping was standardized to explicitly pass individual fields to the `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` constructor, including newly added fields like `Gender`, `Marital_Status`, `County`, and `Contract_Owner_Id`, and a field alias change from `Account_Nbr` to `Primary_Account_Number`.

2.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **11/7/2025, 1:50:13 PM:** This new service class was created, acting as the primary orchestrator for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot. It initializes various HubSpot-related services and a `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`. The `syncPlotBoxData` method outlines logic for fetching data, processing it (with commented-out sections for contact and deal processing), and handling error notifications.
    *   **11/7/2025, 1:50:31 PM:** Renamed `$this->dataToSync` to `$this->plotBoxData` for clarity.

3.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   **11/7/2025, 1:55:10 PM:** This new mapper class was introduced to translate data from `HubSpotDataTransferObject` (and implicitly `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` via `mapPlotBoxToHubSpot`) into HubSpot CRM formats. It handles mapping contact and deal properties, including logic for generating deal names and mapping owner information and pipelines.
    *   **11/7/2025, 1:55:51 PM - 1:56:07 PM:** Added checks for empty DTO inputs (`if (empty($hubspotDto)) { return []; }`) in `mapDeceasedContact` and `mapDeal` for improved robustness.

4.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Console\Commands\Integration\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand.php`**
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:00:23 PM:** This new Artisan command was added to enable command-line execution of the PlotBox-HubSpot data sync. It supports date filtering options (`--date`, `--from-date`, `--to-date`, `--days-back`).
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:02:02 PM:** A temporary `dd($e->getMessage());` debug statement was added in the error handling, disabling email notifications during command execution.

5.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Data\HubSpotDataTransferObject.php`**
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:11:59 PM:** This new DTO class was created to define the data structure for HubSpot entries, with numerous public string properties.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:24:01 PM:** Properties were explicitly marked as nullable (`?string`).
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:24:56 PM:** A debug `dd($uniqueKey);` call in the constructor was removed.

6.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Data\PlotBoxDataTransferObject.php`**
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:28:04 PM:** This new DTO class was introduced, mirroring the HubSpot DTO for PlotBox-specific data. It initially included a `fromDatabase` static factory method, which was subsequently broken (**2:31:05 PM**) and removed (**2:38:26 PM**).
    *   **11/7/2025, 3:19:29 PM - 3:25:17 PM:** New properties `gender` and `maritalStatus` were added to the class, indicating an expansion of data capture for PlotBox contacts.

7.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **11/7/2025, 4:07:02 PM:** This new Eloquent model was introduced, connecting to a Snowflake database (`const CONNECTION = 'snowflake'`). It defined table, primary key, fillable fields, and relationships. It included scope methods and a `getDataForCrmSync` method. The `getDataWithDateRange` method initially contained a simplified SQL query fetching only primary contacts.
    *   **11/7/2025, 4:13:48 PM - 4:31:43 PM:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method underwent substantial changes, transitioning to a more complex CTE-based SQL query to fetch both primary and deceased contact information in a single query. This complex query was iteratively refined for correct filtering and selection of deceased status.
    *   **11/10/2025, 3:05:36 PM - 3:18:56 PM:** The `getDataWithDateRange` was refactored again, moving from a single complex CTE query (which was renamed to `getDataWithDateRange1`) to a two-step process in PHP. This involved fetching living contacts with an Eloquent-style query and then a separate raw SQL query to fetch deceased contacts for the identified contract keys, merging the results in PHP to avoid ODBC cursor issues.
    *   **11/10/2025, 3:43:26 PM - 3:44:10 PM:** Model simplification occurred, with scope methods, accessors, and the `$dates` property being removed, indicating a shift towards using the model primarily for raw SQL data retrieval.
    *   **11/11/2025, 10:45:11 PM - 11:15:50 PM:** The Snowflake query in `getDataWithDateRange` was further enhanced to extract the `Deal_Owner_Email` from a `CONTRACT_OWNERS_JSON` column, assuming it's an array and taking the email from the first element `[0]:email_address`.
    *   **11/12/2025, 12:00:33 AM:** New business logic was introduced to create an `Account_Nbr` by prioritizing the deceased contact's ID, falling back to the primary contact's ID.
    *   **11/12/2025, 12:03:10 AM - 12:06:16 AM:** An attempt to improve SQL parameter binding with named parameters for dates was made, but quickly reverted to direct string interpolation, reintroducing potential SQL injection risks for the date range.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Active Debugging:** Frequent insertion and removal of `dd()` and `var_dump()` calls in multiple files indicate an iterative, debug-heavy development process.
*   **HubSpot Integration Focus:** The core task revolves around integrating data into HubSpot, requiring specific data structures and mappings.
*   **Data Transfer Object (DTO) Usage:** Heavy reliance on `HubSpotDataTransferObject` and `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` to standardize data representation.
*   **Data Transformation:** A `transformKeysToTitleCase` utility is consistently applied to normalize database column names before mapping to DTOs.
*   **Complex Data Retrieval:** The `PlotBox\Contact` model demonstrates a significant effort to craft complex SQL queries (using CTEs and two-step fetches) against a Snowflake database to gather comprehensive contact and contract data, addressing challenges like ODBC compatibility.
*   **Robustness:** Widespread use of the null coalescing operator (`?? null`) in DTO constructors and data mapping ensures graceful handling of missing or null data.
*   **Date-based Synchronization:** The system is designed to sync data based on various date filters, indicating an incremental synchronization strategy.
*   **Incremental Feature Development:** New data fields and specific business logic (like deriving `Account_Nbr` or parsing JSON for owner details) are introduced in distinct, successive changes.

## 3:21:58 PM
The provided logs detail a series of changes across three PHP files within a `datalink` application, primarily focusing on data transfer objects (DTOs) and a repository responsible for syncing data with HubSpot CRM. The changes span from November 7, 2025, to November 12, 2025.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Repositories\EloquentHubSpotRepository.php`**
    *   **Initial state (11/7/2025, 2:22:50 PM):** This file defines the `EloquentHubSpotRepository` class, implementing `HubSpotRepositoryInterface`. It includes methods to fetch HMIS data (`getDataForCrmSync`, `getDataForDate`, `getDataForDateRange`, `getDataForLastDays`) and a private helper `transformKeysToTitleCase` for data formatting. The `getDataForCrmSync` method fetches data and maps it to `HubSpotDataTransferObject`.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:27:13 PM:** A significant change introduces conditional logic within `getDataForCrmSync`. It now checks if the `$modelClass` contains 'PlotBox'. If it does, it attempts to map data to `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` using a static method `PlotBoxDataTransferObject::fromDatabase($item)`. Otherwise, it continues to use `HubSpotDataTransferObject`, adding null coalescing (`?? null`) to all data fields in the constructor call.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:34:34 PM:** The `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` instantiation in `getDataForCrmSync` is changed from `PlotBoxDataTransferObject::fromDatabase($item)` to `new PlotBoxDataTransferObject($item)`. This suggests a shift in how PlotBox data is constructed, possibly moving mapping logic into the DTO's constructor or removing the `fromDatabase` static method.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:38:01 PM:** The PlotBox data mapping is reverted to explicitly passing individual fields with null coalescing to the `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` constructor, mirroring the `HubSpotDataTransferObject` logic, rather than passing the entire `$item` object.
    *   **11/7/2025, 3:18:41 PM:** A `gender` field is added to the `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` constructor call, and an invalid assignment `$item->gender = $Gender ?? null;` is introduced, indicating an attempt to map new data fields.
    *   **11/7/2025, 3:27:58 PM:** A `Marital_Status` field is added to the `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` constructor call, mirroring the `Gender` addition.
    *   **11/7/2025, 3:41:25 PM:** A `County` field is added to the `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` constructor call.
    *   **11/7/2025, 3:42:43 PM:** A `Contract_Owner_Id` field is added to the `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` constructor call, and `Deal_Owner_User_Name` is removed from PlotBox mapping but remains for HubSpot.
    *   **11/7/2025, 3:44:06 PM:** The `Account_Nbr` field for PlotBox is changed to `Primary_Account_Number`.
    *   **11/12/2025, 2:57:56 PM:** The `Contract_Owner_Id` in the `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` constructor call is updated to `Contract_Owners_Json`.
    *   **11/12/2025, 3:02:07 PM & 3:11:09 PM & 3:12:27 PM & 3:15:57 PM:** Multiple instances of `dd($item)` or `dd($hubspotData)` are added and removed, indicating debugging efforts.
    *   **11/12/2025, 3:03:45 PM & 3:03:52 PM & 3:06:01 PM & 3:06:44 PM:** The `Primary_Account_N` field for PlotBox is corrected to `Primary_Account_Nbr` and `Deceased_Account_Number` is changed to `Deceased_Account_Nbr`. The `Sales_Type_Cd` field is also consistently applied to both PlotBox and HubSpot DTOs.
    *   **11/12/2025, 3:15:57 PM:** `Sales_Type_Cd` is removed from `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` constructor.

2.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Data\HubSpotDataTransferObject.php`**
    *   **Initial state (11/7/2025, 2:24:01 PM):** Defines the `HubSpotDataTransferObject` with numerous public string properties and a constructor that initializes them using null coalescing. A `dd($uniqueKey)` statement is present.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:24:56 PM:** The `dd($uniqueKey)` statement is removed, indicating a minor debugging change was committed.

3.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Data\PlotBoxDataTransferObject.php`**
    *   **Initial state (11/7/2025, 2:28:04 PM):** Defines the `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` with many public string properties and a constructor similar to `HubSpotDataTransferObject`. It also includes a static factory method `fromDatabase` for mapping data, and helper methods `getFullName`, `getDeceasedFullName`, `hasValidEmail`, and `hasDeceasedContact`.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:31:05 PM:** The `fromDatabase` static method is significantly broken, incorrectly trying to assign values to `$this` within a static context and essentially duplicating the constructor body instead of mapping from the `$data` parameter.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:32:56 PM:** The `fromDatabase` method is commented out and replaced with a `dd($data)` statement, indicating a temporary debugging phase.
    *   **11/7/2025, 2:38:26 PM:** The `fromDatabase` method is entirely removed.
    *   **11/7/2025, 3:19:29 PM:** A new public property `$gender` is added and initialized in the constructor.
    *   **11/7/2025, 3:25:17 PM:** A new public property `$maritalStatus` is added and initialized in the constructor.
    *   **11/12/2025, 2:34:54 PM:** The `$deceasedReligiousAffiliation` property and its constructor parameter are commented out.
    *   **11/12/2025, 2:40:42 PM:** The `$salesTypeCd` property and its constructor parameter are commented out.
    *   **11/12/2025, 2:43:54 PM:** The `dealOwnerUserName` property is renamed to `dealOwnerEmailAddress` in both property declaration and constructor parameter.
    *   **11/12/2025, 2:44:31 PM:** Many string properties are made nullable (e.g., `public string $uniqueKey;` becomes `public ?string $uniqueKey;`), allowing them to be null instead of always requiring a string. The `purchasePrice` remains a non-nullable string.
    *   **11/12/2025, 2:52:13 PM:** The `$salesTypeCd` property and constructor parameter are uncommented and restored.
    *   **11/12/2025, 2:53:36 PM:** The `$deceasedReligiousAffiliation` property and constructor parameter are uncommented and restored.
    *   **11/12/2025, 2:59:04 PM:** A new public property `$contractOwnersJson` and its constructor parameter are added.
    *   **11/12/2025, 3:02:46 PM & 3:03:22 PM & 3:04:40 PM & 3:05:09 PM:** Minor changes in constructor parameter default values, primarily for consistency with null coalescing (`?? ''` or `?? null`).

4.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **Initial state (11/12/2025, 2:45:06 PM):** This file defines a service for syncing PlotBox data with HubSpot. It instantiates `EloquentHubSpotRepository` with `App\Models\PlotBox\Contact::class` and contains a `syncPlotBoxData` method with commented-out processing logic, relying on `dd($this->plotBoxData)` for debugging.

5.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Repositories\HubSpotRepositoryInterface.php`**
    *   **11/12/2025, 3:07:22 PM:** No changes observed in this log entry, it defines the interface for HubSpot repositories.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):** A consistent pattern involves using DTOs (`HubSpotDataTransferObject`, `PlotBoxDataTransferObject`) to structure and manage data. These DTOs heavily rely on constructor injection of properties, often with null coalescing operators (`?? null` or `?? ''`) to handle potentially missing data gracefully.
*   **Data Transformation:** The `EloquentHubSpotRepository` includes a `transformKeysToTitleCase` method, indicating a need to standardize data keys from the source system to a "Title_Case" format (e.g., `unique_key` becomes `Unique_Key`) before mapping to DTOs.
*   **Conditional Logic for Different Data Sources:** The `EloquentHubSpotRepository::getDataForCrmSync` method clearly distinguishes between "PlotBox data" and "HMIS data" based on the `modelClass`, applying different DTO mapping logic for each. This suggests an abstraction for handling multiple data sources.
*   **Database Interactions (Raw SQL vs. Eloquent):** In `PlotBox\Contact.php`, there's a strong preference for raw SQL queries (`DB::connection(self::CONNECTION)->select(...)`) for `getDataWithDateRange`, citing performance and ODBC cursor issues. This method frequently changes, attempting different SQL structures (e.g., CTEs, correlated subqueries, direct joins) and including `LIMIT` clauses, indicating ongoing optimization and troubleshooting of data retrieval from a Snowflake database.
*   **Debugging:** Frequent addition and removal of `dd()` statements (dump and die) are evident across several files, particularly in `HubSpotDataTransferObject.php` and `EloquentHubSpotRepository.php`, and commenting out large blocks of processing logic in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`. This highlights active development and debugging.
*   **Evolution of `PlotBoxDataTransferObject`:** This DTO undergoes several structural changes, with properties being added (`gender`, `maritalStatus`, `contractOwnersJson`), removed, or having their nullability adjusted. This suggests an iterative refinement of the data model for PlotBox.
*   **Redundant `getHubspotData` methods in `PlotBox\Contact.php`:** The `public function getHubspotData()` method is duplicated in `PlotBox\Contact.php` at one point, which is later commented out. There's also a `getDataWithDateRange1` method that is consistently present alongside `getDataWithDateRange`, suggesting an older or alternative implementation is being kept for reference or comparison, often commented out.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/7/2025, 2:27:13 PM:** Introduction of PlotBox-specific DTO mapping logic in `EloquentHubSpotRepository`.
*   **11/7/2025, 2:31:05 PM:** Initial (faulty) attempt to implement `fromDatabase` static method in `PlotBoxDataTransferObject`.
*   **11/7/2025, 2:38:26 PM:** Removal of the `fromDatabase` static method in `PlotBoxDataTransferObject`.
*   **11/7/2025, 3:19:29 PM & 3:25:17 PM:** Addition of `gender` and `maritalStatus` fields to `PlotBoxDataTransferObject`.
*   **11/7/2025, 3:44:06 PM:** Renaming of `Account_Nbr` to `Primary_Account_Number` in `EloquentHubSpotRepository` when mapping to `PlotBoxDataTransferObject`.
*   **11/10/2025, 3:18:56 PM & 3:23:02 PM & 3:28:56 PM:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method in `PlotBox\Contact.php` is completely refactored from a single large raw SQL query using CTEs to a more structured Laravel Query Builder-like approach (though still using `DB::select` for portions), fetching primary and deceased contacts separately and merging them in PHP, addressing potential ODBC cursor issues. This is a major architectural change for data retrieval.
*   **11/10/2025, 3:33:49 PM:** Reversion of `getDataWithDateRange` in `PlotBox\Contact.php` back to the large single raw SQL query with CTEs.
*   **11/11/2025, 10:45:11 PM:** `PRIMARY_CONTACT_ID` alias added in `primary_contacts` CTE and used in final select statement in `PlotBox\Contact.php`.
*   **11/11/2025, 11:05:36 PM:** `CONTRACT_OWNER_JSON` field added to `base_contracts` CTE in `PlotBox\Contact.php`.
*   **11/11/2025, 11:42:22 PM:** `Contract_Owner_Email` (extracted from `CONTRACT_OWNERS_JSON`) is added to the select statement in `PlotBox\Contact.php`.
*   **11/12/2025, 2:43:54 PM:** Renaming of `dealOwnerUserName` to `dealOwnerEmailAddress` in `PlotBoxDataTransferObject`.
*   **11/12/2025, 2:45:06 PM:** `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` is introduced, showing an initial setup for the sync process but with the core logic commented out for debugging.
*   **11/12/2025, 2:59:04 PM:** Addition of `contractOwnersJson` field to `PlotBoxDataTransferObject`.
*   **11/12/2025, 3:03:45 PM - 3:06:44 PM:** Further adjustments to fields passed to `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` constructor in `EloquentHubSpotRepository`, specifically `Primary_Account_Nbr` and `Deceased_Account_Nbr`.

Overall, the logs show an active development and debugging process centered around integrating PlotBox data into a HubSpot CRM synchronization system. Key areas of change include structuring DTOs, adapting data mapping logic for different sources, and repeatedly refining the complex SQL queries for data extraction from Snowflake, especially for handling primary and deceased contacts associated with contracts.
