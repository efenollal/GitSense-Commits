# Activity Summary for 11/4/2025

## 3:17:04 PM
The file `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Sale.php` is a Laravel Model responsible for interacting with sales data from a PlotBox system. It uses an `sqlsrv_plotbox` connection for the model itself, but its primary data retrieval method, `getDataWithDateRange`, queries a separate `fabric` database connection.

At **11/4/2025, 3:11:30 PM**, the `Sale` model contained a `getDataWithDateRange` static method that executed a complex SQL query. This query joined `DIM_CONTRACT`, `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`, and `DIM_CONTACT` tables from `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` to fetch various details including contact information, contract specifics (number, purchase date, price), and details for a deceased contact associated with the contract. The query filtered records based on a `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` range. A `getHmisData` method was also present, leveraging `getDataWithDateRange` to retrieve data for the current day.

A subsequent update at **11/4/2025, 3:12:55 PM** introduced several refinements to the SQL query within `getDataWithDateRange`. The `SELECT` statement was modified to include `DISTINCT`, ensuring unique rows. More specific filtering was added to the `INNER JOIN` for the primary `DIM_CONTACT`, explicitly setting `DIM_CONTACT.IS_DECEASED = 0` to retrieve only living contacts as primary. Additionally, the `LEFT JOIN` for `DECEASED_CONTACT` was enhanced to explicitly ensure `DECEASED_CONTACT.IS_DECEASED = 1` and, critically, to include `DECEASED_CONTACT.CONTACT_KEY != DIM_CONTACT.CONTACT_KEY`. This last condition prevents the deceased contact from being the same as the primary living contact, improving data accuracy. It's also notable that this update introduced a syntax error by duplicating the function signature `public static function getDataWithDateRange(string $fromDate, string $toDate)` within itself.

A recurring pattern in these changes is the focus on distinguishing between living and deceased contacts associated with sales contracts, along with consistent querying of a `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` schema across multiple joined dimension tables. The queries also consistently use date range filtering on the `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` column.

The file `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Sale.php` underwent several modifications, primarily focusing on the `getDataWithDateRange` method responsible for fetching contact and contract sale information.

**File-Specific Updates:**

The `Sale` model is configured to connect to a `fabric` database, interacting with the `DIM_CONTACT` table and using `CONTACT_KEY` as its primary key. Its main function, `getDataWithDateRange`, retrieves a dataset combining primary contact and deceased contact details associated with sales contracts within a specified date range. A helper method, `getHmisData`, consistently fetches data for the current day.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/4/2025, 3:25:21 PM:** The initial version of `getDataWithDateRange` contained a single, complex SQL query leveraging a `ranked_contacts` Common Table Expression (CTE). This CTE extensively used window functions like `FIRST_VALUE` and `ROW_NUMBER` to aggregate contact and contract data, including details for deceased contacts, from `DIM_CONTRACT`, `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`, and `DIM_CONTACT` tables.
*   **11/4/2025, 3:44:15 PM:** A significant refactoring of the SQL query took place. The single `ranked_contacts` CTE was broken down into three more modular CTEs: `base_contracts`, `living_contacts`, and `deceased_contacts`. This improved the structure and readability of the query while maintaining the same data retrieval logic, using `ROW_NUMBER()` in `living_contacts` and `deceased_contacts` to select a single entry per contract.
*   **11/4/2025, 3:44:55 PM:** A minor update occurred where the `living_contacts` CTE was renamed to `primary_contacts` within the SQL query. However, the alias for this CTE in the final `SELECT` statement (which was `lc`) was not consistently updated to reflect the new name (e.g., `pc`), although the query remained functionally the same.
*   **11/4/2025, 3:53:41 PM:** A potential bug was introduced in the SQL query. An additional date filter, `AND DATE(LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC) BETWEEN $1 AND $2`, was added to the final `SELECT` statement's `WHERE` clause. This filter uses non-standard parameter placeholders (`$1`, `$2`) that conflict with the existing `?` placeholders used by the method, potentially causing SQL errors or unexpected behavior.
*   **11/4/2025, 3:54:00 PM:** The PHP class name was changed from `Sale` to `Contact`. The underlying SQL query remained identical, including the problematic date filter. This suggested an attempt to rename the model to better reflect its `DIM_CONTACT` table mapping.
*   **11/4/2025, 3:55:57 PM:** The PHP class name was reverted back from `Contact` to `Sale`. The SQL query, including the problematic date filter, remained unchanged from the previous version.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**

*   **Iterative SQL Refactoring:** There's a clear pattern of evolving the SQL query from a monolithic structure to a more modular one using multiple CTEs, aiming for better maintainability and clarity.
*   **Consistent Data Fields:** The selected fields (e.g., `Unique_Key`, `Primary_First_Name`, `Sales_Contract_Nbr`, `Deceased_First_Name`) and their aliases remained largely consistent across all versions, indicating a stable requirement for the output data structure.
*   **Reliance on Window Functions:** The use of `ROW_NUMBER()` for selecting distinct primary and deceased contacts per contract is a recurring pattern, indicating a need to handle one-to-many relationships effectively.
*   **Database Interaction:** All SQL queries consistently target the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` schema and involve joins between `DIM_CONTRACT`, `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`, and `DIM_CONTACT` tables.
*   **Date Range Filtering:** The primary filtering mechanism for contracts is `CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN ? AND ?`, which appears consistently in the base CTEs.
