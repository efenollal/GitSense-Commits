# Activity Summary for 11/6/2025

## 11:15:04 AM
The log details recent changes focused on database configurations and a HubSpot integration service, with specific updates to how a database connection is referenced in a data model.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\config\database.php` (Timestamp: 11/6/2025, 10:36:40 AM and 11/6/2025, 10:37:14 AM)**
    This file defines various database connections for the application. It includes configurations for:
    *   Multiple MySQL connections (`laravel`, `sims`, `corpstruct`, `keyserver`, `home_office`, `contract_margin`).
    *   An MSSQL connection (`sqlsrv`) configured for production use (`CAFE-PROD-SQL1`, `STONEMOR_PROD`) with `trust_server_certificate` enabled.
    *   A DB2 connection (`carlib`) utilizing an iSeries Access ODBC Driver, specifying host, username, password, database, schema, port, and a comprehensive list of ODBC keywords.
    *   It sets up default connections for different modules like `sims_connection`, `home_office_connection`, `contract_margin_connection`, and `hmis_connection`.
    *   No functional changes were observed between the two recorded timestamps for this file.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` (Timestamp: 11/6/2025, 10:39:13 AM)**
    This service facilitates the synchronization of PlotBox data from a data warehouse (referred to as Microsoft Fabric/Synapse) to HubSpot CRM.
    *   It leverages `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` to transform data, and `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService` for CRM interactions.
    *   The `syncPlotBoxData` method orchestrates the sync, fetching data, mapping it, and then creating or updating contacts and deals in HubSpot, also associating deals with contacts.
    *   It includes logging for sync progress, error handling for individual record failures, and tracking of created/updated counts.
    *   Helper methods are provided for fetching data from "Fabric," syncing contacts and deals, updating sync status in the source data, and retrieving sync statistics.
    *   A `dd($this->plotBoxData);` statement is present, indicating active development or debugging.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` (Timestamps: 11/6/2025, 10:42:00 AM, 10:43:28 AM, 10:44:59 AM, 10:46:05 AM, 11/6/2025, 10:47:23 AM)**
    This Eloquent model represents a contact record from PlotBox data, mapped to the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT` table in a `snowflake` database connection.
    *   It defines fillable attributes, date fields, and Eloquent relationships (`contractOwners`, `contracts`).
    *   Scopes for `living`, `deceased`, and `withEmail` contacts are provided.
    *   The `getDataForCrmSync` static method is the primary entry point for fetching data, relying on `getDataWithDateRange` or `getHmisData`, and mapping the raw results to `PlotBoxDataTransferObject`.
    *   The `getDataWithDateRange` method executes a complex raw SQL query with CTEs to retrieve contact and contract details, distinguishing between primary and deceased contacts. This query targets `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT` and `DIM_CONTACT`.
    *   **Significant Changes:**
        *   **10:42:00 AM:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method initially uses `DB::connection('fabric')` for its raw SQL query, despite the model's `$connection` being set to `'snowflake'`.
        *   **10:43:28 AM:** Attempted to fix the connection by changing `DB::connection('fabric')` to `DB::connection($this->connection)`. This would fail in a static context.
        *   **10:44:59 AM:** Further refinement to `DB::connection(self::$connection)`, indicating an intention to use a static property.
        *   **10:46:05 AM:** The `$connection` property was correctly declared as `protected static $connection = 'snowflake';` to align with `self::$connection` usage.
        *   **10:47:23 AM:** The `static $connection` property was refactored into a class constant `const CONNECTION = 'snowflake';`, and the `getDataWithDateRange` method was updated to use `DB::connection(self::CONNECTION)`. This is the final and most robust solution for defining and accessing the connection name within static methods.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Database and Data Warehousing Integration:** There is a clear pattern of extensive integration with multiple database types (MySQL, MSSQL, DB2, Snowflake) and a strong focus on data warehousing, particularly with the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` schema and references to Microsoft Fabric/Synapse.
*   **HubSpot CRM Integration:** A dedicated service (`PlotBoxHubSpotService`) and data mapping (`PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`) are being developed to sync diverse data into HubSpot, indicating a critical business process for CRM data consistency.
*   **Iterative Refinement in Static Contexts:** The repeated modifications to `PlotBox\Contact.php` to correctly reference the database connection within a static method (`$this->connection` -> `self::$connection` -> `const CONNECTION`) highlight an iterative development process to resolve issues related to static property access in PHP.
*   **Environment-based Configuration:** All database connections and many other settings (like mail, AWS, SFTP, HubSpot API) are configured using environment variables (`env()`) in `database.php`, indicating adherence to twelve-factor app principles for flexible deployment.
*   **Complex SQL for Data Retrieval:** The use of large, raw SQL queries with CTEs in the `PlotBox\Contact` model suggests that specific, optimized data retrieval logic is required for CRM synchronization, likely due to the complexity of joining contract and contact information from a data warehouse.

## 12:15:01 PM
Changes across the codebase on 11/6/2025 indicate active development focusing on data integration, particularly with HubSpot, and refining database connections.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\config\database.php` (11/6/2025, 10:36:40 AM & 10:37:14 AM):**
    *   This file defines numerous database connections for a Laravel application, including `mysql` (for `laravel`, `sims`, `corpstruct`, `keyserver`, `home_office`, `contract_margin`), `sqlsrv` (for MSSQL, specifically `STONEMOR_PROD`), and a `carlib` connection using a DB2/ODBC driver.
    *   The `carlib` connection is extensively configured with various ODBC keywords.
    *   The entry at 10:37:14 AM shows no functional changes compared to the previous state, suggesting a minor save or no discernible content alteration.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` (11/6/2025, 10:39:13 AM):**
    *   A new service, `PlotBoxHubSpotService`, was introduced. Its primary role is to synchronize PlotBox data, retrieved from a data warehouse, with HubSpot.
    *   It leverages various CRM services (`HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`) and a data mapper (`PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`).
    *   The `syncPlotBoxData` method orchestrates the entire process, fetching data, mapping it, and then creating or updating contacts and deals in HubSpot, including associations. It incorporates logging for progress and error handling.
    *   It contains a temporary debugging statement (`dd($this->plotBoxData);`) at the start of the sync process.
    *   The service includes methods for fetching data from "Fabric" (a database connection), syncing individual contacts and deals, updating sync status in "Fabric", and retrieving sync statistics.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` (multiple timestamps between 11/6/2025, 10:42:00 AM and 10:47:23 AM):**
    *   This Eloquent model (`PlotBox\Contact`) is configured to connect to a `snowflake` database and targets the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT` table.
    *   It defines relationships (`contractOwners`, `contracts`) and scopes (`living`, `deceased`, `withEmail`).
    *   A significant static method, `getDataForCrmSync`, acts as a central point for retrieving contact data for CRM synchronization. This method ultimately calls `getDataWithDateRange` or `getHmisData`.
    *   `getDataWithDateRange` contains a complex raw SQL query designed to fetch detailed contact and contract information, including distinctions between primary and deceased contacts, from the data warehouse (initially targeting a `fabric` connection).
    *   **10:43:28 AM:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method was updated to use `$this->connection` for its database query, attempting to dynamically use the model's defined connection instead of a hardcoded 'fabric' connection.
    *   **10:44:59 AM:** This was further refined, changing `$this->connection` to `self::$connection`, indicating an attempt to correctly access the connection property within a static method.
    *   **10:46:05 AM:** The `$connection` property itself was modified from `protected $connection` to `protected static $connection`, making it a static property to align with the previous change.
    *   **10:47:23 AM:** The `static $connection` property was refactored into a class constant `const CONNECTION = 'snowflake';`, and its usage in `DB::connection()` was updated accordingly (`self::CONNECTION`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Data Integration with HubSpot:** A clear focus on syncing data from an internal data source (PlotBox, residing in a data warehouse like Snowflake/Fabric) to HubSpot, managing contacts, deals, and their associations.
*   **Database Connection Management:** There's ongoing effort to precisely define and manage database connections, particularly for data warehouse interactions (e.g., Snowflake, Fabric), and a specific sequence of changes to ensure the correct database connection (`snowflake`) is used within a static method of the `PlotBox\Contact` model.
*   **Raw SQL for Performance:** Despite using Eloquent models, complex data retrieval for CRM synchronization is implemented using raw SQL queries, likely for performance optimization against large data warehouse tables.
*   **Iterative Development:** The rapid succession of changes to the `PlotBox\Contact.php` file, specifically regarding the database connection property and its access within a static method, suggests an active debugging or refinement process.

## 1:15:03 PM
**File-Specific Updates and Significant Changes:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\config\database.php`**
    *   **11/6/2025, 10:36:40 AM:** This file underwent significant expansion. New default connections were added for `sims`, `home_office`, `contract_margin`, `hmis`, and `hmis_test`, all dynamically configured via environment variables. Detailed connection settings were introduced for `sims` (MySQL), `corpstruct` (MySQL), `keyserver` (MySQL), `home_office` (MySQL), `contract_margin` (MySQL), `sqlsrv` (MSSQL), and `carlib` (DB2). The `carlib` connection includes extensive ODBC keywords and specific DB2 parameters. Migration paths were also defined for several MySQL connections.
    *   **11/6/2025, 10:37:14 AM:** No functional changes were observed in this entry; it appears to be an identical save of the previous version.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **11/6/2025, 10:39:13 AM:** A new service, `PlotBoxHubSpotService`, was introduced. Its primary function is to synchronize PlotBox data from a Microsoft Fabric/Synapse data source to HubSpot. Key functionalities include:
        *   Fetching data from a `hubSpotRepository` (which connects to `fabric`).
        *   Mapping PlotBox data to HubSpot format using `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`.
        *   Synchronizing contacts and deals with HubSpot via `HubSpotContactService` and `HubSpotDealService`, including creation, updates, and associations.
        *   Logging sync progress and errors.
        *   Methods for updating sync status and retrieving sync statistics from the Fabric database.
        *   A `dd($this->plotBoxData)` call is present, indicating a debug breakpoint.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **11/6/2025, 10:42:00 AM:** This file defines the `Contact` Eloquent model for PlotBox, connecting to a `snowflake` database and specifically targeting the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT` table. It includes:
        *   `$fillable` fields covering contact details (name, email, address, etc.).
        *   Eloquent relationships with `ContractOwner` and `Contract` models.
        *   Scopes (`scopeLiving`, `scopeDeceased`, `scopeWithEmail`) for filtering contacts.
        *   An accessor for `fullName`.
        *   A static `getDataForCrmSync` method to retrieve data for CRM integration, which delegates to `getDataWithDateRange` (executing a complex raw SQL query on the `fabric` connection) or `getHmisData`.
    *   **11/6/2025, 10:43:28 AM:** A change was made in the `getDataWithDateRange` method, attempting to switch the database connection from `DB::connection('fabric')` to `DB::connection($this->connection)`. This would cause an error as `getDataWithDateRange` is a static method and `this` is not available.
    *   **11/6/2025, 10:44:59 AM:** The problematic `DB::connection($this->connection)` was updated to `DB::connection(self::$connection)`, attempting to access a static property.
    *   **11/6/2025, 10:46:05 AM:** The `$connection` property was explicitly changed from a protected instance property to a `protected static $connection = 'snowflake';` to support the static method's access pattern.
    *   **11/6/2025, 10:47:23 AM:** The `protected static $connection` property was further refined to `const CONNECTION = 'snowflake';`, making the connection name a class constant, and `getDataWithDateRange` was updated to `DB::connection(self::CONNECTION)` accordingly.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Extensive Database Integration:** A strong pattern of integrating with various database systems (MySQL, MSSQL, DB2, Snowflake, Microsoft Fabric/Synapse) is evident, largely driven by environment variables for configuration. This suggests a complex data ecosystem requiring connections to multiple internal and external data sources.
*   **HubSpot as a Central CRM:** HubSpot is being established as a key CRM, with dedicated services and data synchronization logic being developed to feed it with information from other systems, specifically PlotBox data.
*   **Data Warehouse Utilization:** The `PlotBox\Contact` model and `PlotBoxHubSpotService` explicitly mention and interact with Snowflake and Microsoft Fabric/Synapse, indicating a reliance on data warehouses for source data for CRM synchronization.
*   **Evolution of Static Property Handling:** The `PlotBox\Contact.php` file shows a clear sequence of changes to correctly manage and access a database connection property (`$connection` -> `static $connection` -> `const CONNECTION`) from within static methods, reflecting iterative development and debugging to resolve scope issues.
*   **Raw SQL for Performance:** Despite the use of Eloquent, complex data retrieval logic for CRM synchronization in `PlotBox\Contact` utilizes raw SQL queries for potentially better performance when querying data warehouses.

## 2:15:03 PM
The `config/database.php` file, last modified on 11/6/2025 at 10:37:14 AM (after an identical change at 10:36:40 AM), defines a comprehensive set of database connections for the application. It establishes connections for various MySQL databases (default 'laravel', 'sims', 'corpstruct', 'keyserver', 'home_office', 'contract_margin'), an MSSQL ('sqlsrv') connection, and a detailed DB2 ('carlib') connection using an ODBC driver. All these connections extensively utilize environment variables for their configuration, supporting a flexible setup. There are also commented-out sections for PostgreSQL and other ODBC/DB2 driver attempts.

The `app/SMCore/Services/PlotBox/PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` file, updated on 11/6/2025 at 10:39:13 AM, outlines a service responsible for synchronizing PlotBox data from a Microsoft Fabric/Synapse data warehouse to HubSpot CRM. Key functionalities include:
*   Fetching PlotBox data using a repository, with a debug `dd()` statement present in the `syncPlotBoxData` method.
*   Mapping this data to a HubSpot-compatible format using `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`.
*   Creating or updating contacts and deals in HubSpot based on the mapped data.
*   Associating deals with contacts.
*   Updating the synchronization status (e.g., 'synced', 'pending') and last sync date back in the Fabric data source.
*   Providing methods to retrieve sync statistics from Fabric.

The `app/Models/PlotBox/Contact.php` file underwent several rapid changes between 11/6/2025, 10:42:00 AM, and 10:47:23 AM. This Eloquent model maps to a `DIM_CONTACT` table within a Snowflake data warehouse. The iterations focused on refining how a static data retrieval method (`getDataWithDateRange`) accesses the database connection:
*   Initially (10:42:00 AM), the model specified a `$connection = 'snowflake'` but the `getDataWithDateRange` method incorrectly hardcoded `DB::connection('fabric')`.
*   A subsequent change (10:43:28 AM) attempted to use `$this->connection` within the static method, which is syntactically incorrect.
*   This was corrected (10:44:59 AM) by changing it to `self::$connection`, requiring the `$connection` property to be `static`.
*   The property was then updated to `protected static $connection = 'snowflake';` (10:46:05 AM).
*   Finally (10:47:23 AM), the connection name was refactored to a class constant `const CONNECTION = 'snowflake';`, and `DB::connection(self::CONNECTION)` was used.
Throughout these changes, the model consistently defined relationships (`contractOwners`, `contracts`), scopes (`living`, `deceased`, `withEmail`), and an accessor (`getFullNameAttribute`). Its core function `getDataForCrmSync` uses a complex raw SQL query with CTEs to extract detailed contact and contract information for CRM synchronization, distinguishing between primary and deceased contacts.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Multi-Database Integration:** The project heavily integrates with various database systems, including MySQL, MSSQL, DB2, Snowflake, and Microsoft Fabric/Synapse, indicating a complex data ecosystem.
*   **HubSpot as a CRM Target:** There's a clear emphasis on synchronizing data to HubSpot, particularly contact and deal information.
*   **Data Warehousing:** PlotBox data is sourced from a data warehouse (Snowflake and Fabric/Synapse), implying a robust ETL/ELT process is in place for these data sources.
*   **Configuration Management:** Extensive use of environment variables for database credentials and other settings demonstrates a preference for externalized configuration.
*   **Active Development & Refinement:** The rapid succession of changes in `PlotBox\Contact.php` highlights ongoing development and debugging, specifically to correctly handle static database connections within an Eloquent model. The `dd()` statement in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` also points to active debugging.
*   **Data Mapping:** The presence of `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` and `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` indicates a focus on structuring and transforming data for cross-system compatibility.

## 3:15:01 PM
The `config/database.php` file was updated at `11/6/2025, 10:36:40 AM`. This file defines numerous database connections for the application, including:
*   Standard `mysql` connections (e.g., `laravel`, `sims`, `home_office`, `contract_margin`, `corpstruct`, `keyserver`).
*   A `sqlsrv` connection pointed to `CAFE-PROD-SQL1` for `STONEMOR_PROD`.
*   A `carlib` connection for DB2, using `db2_ibmi_odbc` driver and configured with an extensive list of ODBC keywords.
*   The connections generally retrieve their configuration values from environment variables using `env()`. A subsequent log entry for this file at `11/6/2025, 10:37:14 AM` shows no content changes.

The `app/SMCore/Services/PlotBox/PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` file was modified at `11/6/2025, 10:39:13 AM`. This service is designed to synchronize PlotBox data from a data warehouse (referred to as Fabric/Synapse in comments, and later explicitly using `DB::connection('fabric')`) to HubSpot.
*   It utilizes various internal services for HubSpot contact, deal, and location management, along with a `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` and `EloquentHubSpotRepository`.
*   The main `syncPlotBoxData` method orchestrates fetching data, mapping it, and then creating or updating contacts and deals in HubSpot, including association with contacts.
*   It includes a `dd($this->plotBoxData);` statement, suggesting active debugging during the change.
*   Error logging is implemented for different stages of the sync process.
*   It contains methods to `updateSyncStatus` and `getSyncStatistics` on the source `plotbox_data` table in the `fabric` connection.

The `app/Models/PlotBox/Contact.php` file saw multiple rapid changes, indicating active development:
*   Initial state at `11/6/2025, 10:42:00 AM`: This Eloquent model (`App\Models\PlotBox\Contact`) is configured to use the `snowflake` database connection, targeting the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT` table. It defines fillable attributes, relationships (e.g., `contractOwners`, `contracts`), and scopes for filtering contacts (living, deceased, with email). It also provides an accessor for `fullName`. A key method, `getDataForCrmSync`, handles fetching data, which at this point, calls `getDataWithDateRange` or `getHmisData`. The `getDataWithDateRange` method executes a complex raw SQL query against `DB::connection('fabric')` to retrieve detailed contact and contract information, joining several dimension tables.
*   Update at `11/6/2025, 10:43:28 AM`: The `getDataWithDateRange` method's `DB::connection` call was modified from `DB::connection('fabric')` to `DB::connection($this->connection)`. This change aimed to make the query use the connection defined by the model's `$connection` property (which is `snowflake`) instead of hardcoding `fabric`.
*   Update at `11/6/2025, 10:44:59 AM`: Further refinement in `getDataWithDateRange` changed the connection call to `DB::connection(self::$connection)`. This implies an intention to access the `$connection` property statically, but `protected $connection` was still a non-static property at this point, potentially introducing a bug.
*   Update at `11/6/2025, 10:46:05 AM`: The `$connection` property itself was modified from `protected $connection = 'snowflake';` to `protected static $connection = 'snowflake';`. This corrected the previous change by making the property static, allowing `self::$connection` to be properly resolved in the static `getDataWithCrmSync` and `getDataWithDateRange` methods.
*   Final update at `11/6/2025, 10:47:23 AM`: The `protected static $connection` property was refactored into a class constant: `const CONNECTION = 'snowflake';`. Consequently, the `getDataWithDateRange` method was updated to reference `self::CONNECTION`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Database Integration:** There's a strong focus on connecting to and managing multiple database systems, including MySQL, MSSQL (SQLSRV), IBM DB2 (CARLIB), and Snowflake. The `.env` file, though not summarized, shows configurations for many data sources.
*   **Data Synchronization (PlotBox to HubSpot):** A significant development effort is dedicated to syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot, involving data mapping, CRM service calls, and status tracking.
*   **Connection Management in Models:** The rapid changes in `PlotBox\Contact.php` regarding `DB::connection()` illustrate an iterative process of correctly accessing the model's specified database connection from static methods, evolving from a hardcoded connection to a dynamic property, then a static property, and finally a class constant.
*   **Use of Environment Variables:** The `config/database.php` heavily relies on `env()` calls to fetch configuration values, indicating a flexible and environment-aware setup.
*   **Raw SQL Queries:** The `PlotBox\Contact.php` model uses a complex raw SQL query, suggesting performance optimization for data fetching rather than relying solely on Eloquent's ORM capabilities for specific, large data retrieval tasks.
*   **Date/Time Specificity:** Timestamps for file changes are very close together, indicating a concentrated period of development and refinement, particularly within the `PlotBox\Contact.php` model.

## 4:15:19 PM
The provided log details a series of code changes primarily focused on integrating PlotBox data from a data warehouse (Snowflake/Fabric) with HubSpot CRM. The changes span across database configuration, a data synchronization service, a data model, and an Artisan command.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\config\database.php` (Multiple timestamps: 11/6/2025, 10:36:40 AM to 4:06:57 PM):**
    *   This file consistently defines various database connections, including `mysql` (laravel, sims, corpstruct, keyserver, home_office, contract_margin), `sqlsrv`, and `carlib` (DB2 ODBC).
    *   A critical observation is that while the `.env` file specifies `DB_CONNECTION=snowflake` and provides Snowflake credentials, the `database.php` configuration *does not contain an explicit 'snowflake' connection block*. This discrepancy is a likely source of the recurring connection errors seen in the logs.
    *   No functional code changes are observed in `database.php` across the provided timestamps, meaning the configuration remained static throughout the logged period.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` (11/6/2025, 10:39:13 AM):**
    *   A new service, `PlotBoxHubSpotService`, was introduced to manage the synchronization of PlotBox data to HubSpot.
    *   It contains methods for initiating the sync (`syncPlotBoxData`), fetching data from a "Fabric/Synapse" connection (initially `DB::connection('fabric')`), and handling contact and deal synchronization with HubSpot.
    *   A debugging `dd($this->plotBoxData);` statement was present, indicating active development and testing of the data fetching process.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` (Multiple timestamps: 11/6/2025, 10:42:00 AM to 4:07:31 PM):**
    *   This Eloquent model is designated to fetch contact data from the `snowflake` connection (`const CONNECTION = 'snowflake';`).
    *   **10:43:28 AM:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query shifted from using `DB::connection('fabric')` to `DB::connection($this->connection)`, attempting to use the model's defined `snowflake` connection.
    *   **10:44:59 AM - 10:47:23 AM:** The model's connection property was progressively refined from `$this->connection` to `self::$connection` and finally `const CONNECTION`, improving consistency and preventing runtime modification.
    *   **3:32:41 PM - 3:37:26 PM:** The SQL query within `getDataWithDateRange` underwent iterative changes concerning its `WHERE` clause for date filtering, attempting to apply the date range to the main `SELECT` statement directly, then reverting to apply it only in the initial CTE.
    *   **3:51:00 PM:** A significant refactoring of the `getDataWithDateRange` SQL query occurred. The complex CTE-based approach (combining primary and deceased contacts) was replaced with a simpler direct join, primarily fetching *living* primary contacts and explicitly setting deceased contact fields to `NULL`. The `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.` schema prefix was removed from table names in this query, implying that the schema is expected to be configured at the connection level.
    *   **3:53:36 PM:** The refactored SQL query was updated to include `con.CONTRACT_KEY AS Contract_Key` in the `SELECT` and `ORDER BY Contract_Key`.
    *   **3:57:23 PM:** Minor syntax change in SQL query from `CAST(con.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE)` to `DATE(con.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC)`.
    *   **4:07:31 PM:** A `testSimpleQuery` method was added to allow basic connectivity testing to the `snowflake` database.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\storage\logs\laravel-2025-11-06.log` (11/6/2025, 3:18:40 PM):**
    *   The log shows a recurring pattern of `local.ERROR: Please make sure the environment variable: "DB_ODBC_DRIVER" was set properly in the .env file.` This error consistently points to issues connecting to the `snowflake` database via an ODBC driver. The stack traces indicate these failures occur during the `Illuminate\Database\DatabaseManager->makeConnection('snowflake')` call.
    *   Interspersed with errors are `local.INFO: Fetching all locations from HubSpot` messages, suggesting that some parts of the HubSpot integration were attempting to function.
    *   An `Unable to create PsySH runtime directory` error also appeared, indicating an environmental issue with PHP's temporary file handling.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Console\Commands\Integration\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand.php` (Multiple timestamps: 11/6/2025, 3:29:13 PM to 3:29:34 PM):**
    *   A new Artisan command (`hub:plotbox-hubspot-data-push`) was created to trigger the PlotBox-to-HubSpot data synchronization.
    *   It supports various date filtering options (specific date, date range, days back).
    *   Debugging `dd()` statements were present in the `sendErrorNotification` method, initially dumping the `$hubspotProcess` array, then changed to dump the `$e` (exception) object for more focused error investigation.
    *   An unusual, likely leftover, duplicate call to `syncPlotBoxData` existed at the end of the `handle` method, outside the `try-catch` block.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/6/2025, 10:39:13 AM:** Introduction of `PlotBoxHubSpotService` with initial Fabric connection attempt and a `dd()` statement.
*   **11/6/2025, 10:43:28 AM:** `PlotBox\Contact` model switches from `fabric` connection to `snowflake` for its raw SQL query.
*   **11/6/2025, 10:47:23 AM:** `PlotBox\Contact` model formalizes its connection as a `const CONNECTION = 'snowflake';`.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:18:40 PM (log entries from ~10:14 AM to 10:38 AM):** Recurring ODBC driver errors for Snowflake connection are prominently logged, indicating a persistent configuration or environment issue.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:29:13 PM:** Introduction of `PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand` with date filtering capabilities and debugging `dd()` in error handling.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:51:00 PM:** Major refactoring of the SQL query in `PlotBox\Contact::getDataWithDateRange` to simplify fetching primary contacts.
*   **11/6/2025, 4:07:31 PM:** Addition of a `testSimpleQuery` method to `PlotBox\Contact` for Snowflake connection debugging.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **PlotBox-HubSpot Integration Focus:** The overall pattern revolves around setting up and debugging a data pipeline from PlotBox (accessed via a Snowflake/Fabric data warehouse) to HubSpot.
*   **Persistent Database Connectivity Issues:** Repeated `DB_ODBC_DRIVER` errors in the log, coupled with the absence of a `snowflake` connection block in `config/database.php` despite the `.env` configuration, highlight a significant and ongoing challenge with the Snowflake ODBC connection.
*   **Iterative Debugging and Refinement:** The frequent changes to SQL queries within `PlotBox\Contact.php`, the use and modification of `dd()` statements in both the service and command files, and the addition of a `testSimpleQuery` method all indicate an active, iterative debugging process to resolve data fetching and integration issues.
*   **SQL Query Evolution:** The complex CTE-based SQL query initially designed for `PlotBox\Contact` was simplified, suggesting a move towards a more direct and potentially efficient data retrieval strategy. The removal of the schema prefix from table names also points to a refined database configuration approach.
*   **Date Filtering Complexity:** The date filtering logic was a point of repeated modification, suggesting challenges in correctly applying date ranges for data synchronization.

## 5:15:25 PM
The code changes primarily revolve around the integration of "PlotBox" data with HubSpot, leveraging a Snowflake data warehouse. The activity spans from November 6, 2025, 10:36 AM to 5:13 PM, indicating an active development and debugging session.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\config\database.php`**
    *   (Multiple identical entries between 11/6/2025, 10:36:40 AM and 11/6/2025, 5:02:13 PM)
    *   This file consistently defines numerous database connections (MySQL, MSSQL, DB2, Snowflake) by retrieving configuration from environment variables. While many log entries for this file show no functional changes, it serves as the central configuration point for all database interactions. The `snowflake` connection is detailed with server, DSN, account, username, password, database, warehouse, schema, and role settings.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   (Initial state at 11/6/2025, 10:39:13 AM)
    *   This service handles the core logic for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot. It uses injected HubSpot contact and deal services, along with a data mapper. The `syncPlotBoxData` method, observed at its initial entry, includes a `dd($this->plotBoxData)` debugging statement, suggesting active development or troubleshooting. It defines methods for fetching data from a "Fabric" connection (later implicitly Snowflake), updating sync statuses, and retrieving statistics.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   (Initial state at 11/6/2025, 10:42:00 AM)
    *   This Eloquent model represents PlotBox contacts and is configured to use the `snowflake` database connection. Its primary function `getDataForCrmSync` fetches contact data, initially using a complex SQL query with CTEs.
    *   **11/6/2025, 10:43:28 AM**: The database connection for raw SQL queries within `getDataWithDateRange` was changed from a hardcoded 'fabric' to the model's configured connection (`$this->connection`), indicating a move towards more dynamic connection handling.
    *   **11/6/2025, 10:46:05 AM**: The `$connection` property was made `static`, and later refined to a `const CONNECTION` at **11/6/2025, 10:47:23 AM** for better practice in constant usage.
    *   **11/6/2025, 3:32:41 PM**: A `WHERE` clause was added to the main SQL query to filter for data updated `CURRENT_DATE()`, which was then immediately reverted at **11/6/2025, 3:33:31 PM** to correctly use the `BETWEEN ? AND ?` date range parameters.
    *   **11/6/2025, 3:51:00 PM**: The complex CTE-based SQL query in `getDataWithDateRange` was replaced by a simpler `SELECT DISTINCT` query, with the old query commented out. This suggests an attempt to simplify or address issues with the complex query.
    *   **11/6/2025, 3:57:23 PM**: Schema prefixes (`WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.`) were removed from table names within the SQL query, indicating a change in how schema is resolved.
    *   **11/6/2025, 4:30:12 PM**: The model's `$table` property was updated to include a more explicit database/schema path (`PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT`).
    *   **11/6/2025, 4:32:26 PM**: The previously simplified SQL query was commented out, and the original, complex CTE-based query was reinstated in `getDataWithDateRange`.
    *   **11/6/2025, 4:34:31 PM**: SQL query parameters were changed from `?` to `$1`, `$2` and later string interpolation (`'{$fromDate}'`, `'{$toDate}'`) at **11/6/2025, 4:35:38 PM** and **11/6/2025, 4:37:46 PM**, which could introduce SQL injection risks if not carefully handled.
    *   **11/6/2025, 4:49:44 PM**: The complex CTE query was renamed to `getDataWithDateRange1`, and a new `getDataWithDateRange` method was introduced, which effectively reimplemented the *simplified* SQL query from 3:51:00 PM, using a single date parameter. Logging for query failures was also added, requiring `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log;` at **11/6/2025, 4:50:13 PM**.
    *   **11/6/2025, 4:56:30 PM**: Incorrect attempts were made to embed environment variable names directly into table and relationship strings (e.g., `'PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.SNOWFLAKE_DB_SCHEMA=EVERSTORYPARTNERS_SHARED_SCHEMA .DIM_CONTACT'`), which were subsequently corrected at **11/6/2025, 4:59:15 PM** and **11/6/2025, 5:03:53 PM** to use proper, fully qualified database/schema.table names like `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\storage\logs\laravel-2025-11-06.log`**
    *   (Entries from 11/6/2025, 10:14:23 AM to 11/6/2025, 10:15:29 AM)
    *   Repeated `local.ERROR` messages concerning the `DB_ODBC_DRIVER` environment variable being improperly set for the Snowflake connection, originating from `LaravelPdoOdbc\ODBCConnector.php`. This indicates persistent configuration issues.
    *   Informational logs show "Fetching all locations from HubSpot", suggesting other processes were running.
    *   A `Psy\Exception\RuntimeException` at **11/6/2025, 10:38:42 AM** indicates a permission issue preventing PsySH (PHP interactive shell) from creating its runtime directory.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Console\Commands\Integration\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand.php`**
    *   (Initial state at 11/6/2025, 3:29:13 PM)
    *   This Artisan command orchestrates the PlotBox-HubSpot sync and supports various date filters.
    *   **11/6/2025, 3:29:34 PM** and **11/6/2025, 4:15:36 PM**: Debugging output in the `sendErrorNotification` method was refined from `dd($hubspotProcess)` to `dd($e)` and then `dd($e->getMessage())`, indicating a focused effort to inspect exception details during failures.
    *   **11/6/2025, 4:21:23 PM**: Log and information messages were updated for consistency, changing "HMIS HubSpot data sync" to "PlotBox HubSpot data sync".
    *   **11/6/2025, 4:25:18 PM**: A redundant call to `$this->plotBoxHubSpotService->syncPlotBoxData($this);` at the end of the `handle()` method was removed.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contract.php`**
    *   (Initial state at 11/6/2025, 4:20:01 PM)
    *   This Eloquent model defines PlotBox contracts using the `snowflake` connection and `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT` table. It includes relationships to contacts and contract owners and provides various query scopes.
    *   **11/6/2025, 4:30:25 PM**: The `$table` property was updated to include `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.` prefix.
    *   **11/6/2025, 4:56:59 PM**: An incorrect attempt to embed environment variable names into the `$table` and relationship definitions was made, similar to the `Contact.php` model.
    *   **11/6/2025, 5:08:59 PM**: This incorrect syntax was largely corrected, although a minor typo (`PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSEWAREHOUSE`) was introduced in the `$table` name.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\ContractOwner.php`**
    *   (Initial state at 11/6/2025, 4:20:08 PM)
    *   This Eloquent model defines contract owners, also using the `snowflake` connection and `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER` table.
    *   **11/6/2025, 4:30:46 PM**: The `$table` property was updated to include `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.` prefix.
    *   **11/6/2025, 4:56:40 PM**: Similar to other PlotBox models, an incorrect attempt to embed environment variable names into the `$table` property was made.
    *   **11/6/2025, 5:08:30 PM**: This incorrect syntax was corrected.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Snowflake Integration:** A primary theme is the integration with a Snowflake data warehouse, indicated by explicit `snowflake` connection definitions and table references.
*   **Database Schema Pathing:** There's a consistent struggle to correctly specify the full database and schema path within models (e.g., `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT` evolving to `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT`), sometimes leading to syntactical errors where environment variable names are incorrectly embedded in string literals.
*   **SQL Query Optimization/Troubleshooting:** The `PlotBox\Contact.php` model shows a pattern of switching between complex SQL queries (with CTEs) and simpler direct joins, and experimentation with SQL parameterization versus string interpolation. This suggests ongoing efforts to optimize query performance or resolve compatibility issues with the Snowflake ODBC driver.
*   **Debugging Emphasis:** The frequent presence of `dd()` calls in services and commands, coupled with detailed error logs for `DB_ODBC_DRIVER` issues, points to an intensive debugging phase for the Snowflake connection and the sync process.
*   **Laravel Framework Usage:** The project heavily uses Laravel's Eloquent ORM, console commands, and database configuration, indicating a well-structured PHP application.
*   **Data Synchronization to HubSpot:** The overall goal is to synchronize "PlotBox" data (contacts, contracts, contract owners) to HubSpot, with mechanisms for date-based filtering, error handling, and notification.

## 6:15:05 PM
The provided log details changes across several PHP files related to a "datalink" application, primarily focusing on database configuration, HubSpot integration for PlotBox data, and associated logging.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\config\database.php`**
    *   **Initial state (11/6/2025, 10:36:40 AM):** Defines numerous database connections (e.g., `sqlite`, `laravel` (MySQL), `sims`, `corpstruct`, `keyserver`, `home_office`, `contract_margin`, `sqlsrv` for MSSQL, and `carlib` for DB2 using ODBC). It includes placeholder comments for `pgsql` and various failed `odbc` driver attempts. Snowflake connection details are commented out at this point, indicating it's not actively used.
    *   **Recurring (11/6/2025, 10:37:14 AM - 4:24:06 PM):** This file is repeatedly saved without significant functional changes between these timestamps. The content remains largely identical to its initial state, continuing to define various database connections and comment out the Snowflake configuration.
    *   **Update (11/6/2025, 4:47:34 PM):** The commented-out Snowflake connection details are now configured, specifically setting `SNOWFLAKE_DB_DSN` to include the driver, server, database, schema, warehouse, port, and log level. This signifies an activation or attempt to configure a direct ODBC connection for Snowflake. The `SNOWFLAKE_DB_SCHEMA` variable appears to be duplicated and modified for the specific schema within the DSN string itself.
    *   **Further Update (11/6/2025, 5:02:13 PM):** No functional changes observed.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **Initial state (11/6/2025, 10:39:13 AM):** Introduces a service for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot. It uses `EloquentHubSpotRepository` with `App\Models\PlotBox\Contact::class` as the model. Contains methods for `syncPlotBoxData`, `fetchPlotBoxDataFromFabric` (which attempts a `DB::connection('fabric')->select` query, despite 'fabric' not being explicitly defined in the `database.php` logs), `syncContact`, `syncDeal`, `updateSyncStatus`, and `getSyncStatistics`. A `dd($this->plotBoxData)` is present, indicating debugging in `syncPlotBoxData`.
    *   **Update (11/6/2025, 5:19:52 PM):** This version remains largely the same, still using the `dd($this->plotBoxData)` for debugging, and `fetchPlotBoxDataFromFabric` continues to attempt a `DB::connection('fabric')`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **Initial state (11/6/2025, 10:42:00 AM):** Defines an Eloquent model for `Contact` connected to `snowflake` (though previously inactive in `database.php`). The table is `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT`. It includes relationships (`contractOwners`, `contracts`), scopes (`Living`, `Deceased`, `WithEmail`), an accessor for full name, and methods for CRM sync: `getDataForCrmSync`, `getDataWithDateRange`, and `getHmisData`. The `getDataWithDateRange` method initially uses a complex raw SQL query with Common Table Expressions (CTEs) against `DB::connection('fabric')`.
    *   **Updates (11/6/2025, 10:43:28 AM - 10:47:23 AM):** Changes are made to how the database connection is referenced within `getDataWithDateRange`, transitioning from `DB::connection('fabric')` to `DB::connection($this->connection)` and finally to `DB::connection(self::CONNECTION)`. A `const CONNECTION = 'snowflake'` is introduced at 10:47:23 AM.
    *   **Update (11/6/2025, 3:32:41 PM):** A `WHERE DATE(LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC) = CURRENT_DATE()` clause is added to the primary_contacts subquery in `getDataWithDateRange`, which is quickly reverted.
    *   **Update (11/6/2025, 3:33:31 PM):** The `WHERE` clause is modified back to use `BETWEEN ? AND ?` for `CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE)`.
    *   **Update (11/6/2025, 3:51:00 PM):** The complex SQL query using CTEs in `getDataWithDateRange` is replaced with a simpler `SELECT DISTINCT` query directly joining `DIM_CONTRACT`, `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`, and `DIM_CONTACT`. This new query specifically fetches *only* living contacts (`dc.IS_DECEASED = 0`) and sets deceased contact fields to `NULL`. The previous CTE-based query that differentiated between primary and deceased contacts is commented out.
    *   **Updates (11/6/2025, 3:53:36 PM - 4:07:31 PM):** Minor adjustments in the `SELECT` clause, adding `con.CONTRACT_KEY AS Contract_Key` and modifying the `ORDER BY` clause to use `Contract_Key`. Also, the explicit `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` schema is removed from table names within the SQL query, implying a default schema might be used, or it's implicitly handled by the connection. A new `testSimpleQuery` method is added to verify the Snowflake connection.
    *   **Update (11/6/2025, 4:30:12 PM):** The `$table` property is updated to include the full schema path: `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT`.
    *   **Updates (11/6/2025, 4:32:26 PM - 4:35:38 PM):** The raw SQL query in `getDataWithDateRange` is changed several times. It's briefly commented out entirely, then reintroduced with placeholder changes (`$1` and `$2` instead of `?`) and then back to string interpolation with `{$fromDate}` and `{$toDate}` for the date parameters within the SQL query itself, instead of using prepared statement parameters. This might be a debugging step or a change in how parameters are handled.
    *   **Update (11/6/2025, 4:50:13 PM):** The `getDataWithDateRange` method is reverted to a simpler direct `SELECT` query, specifically filtering `WHERE DATE(con.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC) = ?` using a single `fromDate` parameter. The more complex CTE query (labeled `getDataWithDateRange1`) is kept. `getHmisData` now calls `getDataWithDateRange` with today's date for both `from` and `to`. A `Log` facade is imported.
    *   **Update (11/6/2025, 5:03:53 PM - 5:11:05 PM):** The schema path in the `getDataWithDateRange` query is updated to be `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.EVERSTORYPARTNERS_SHARED_SCHEMAS.DIM_CONTRACT` (plural `SCHEMAS` in one instance, corrected to singular `SCHEMA`). A new public method `getPlotBoxData()` is added, which calls `getDataWithDateRange` for today's date.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Console\Commands\Integration\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand.php`**
    *   **Initial state (11/6/2025, 3:29:13 PM):** Defines a Laravel Artisan command (`hub:plotbox-hubspot-data-push`) for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot. It supports date filtering via `--date`, `--from-date`/`--to-date`, or `--days-back` options. It calls `PlotBoxHubSpotService->syncPlotBoxData` and has error handling and notification logic. Includes `dd($error)` in `sendErrorNotification`.
    *   **Update (11/6/2025, 3:29:34 PM):** The `dd($error)` in `sendErrorNotification` is changed to `dd($e)`, debugging the exception directly.
    *   **Update (11/6/2025, 4:15:36 PM):** `dd($e)` is changed to `dd($e->getMessage())` for more concise error debugging.
    *   **Update (11/6/2025, 4:21:23 PM):** Multiple instances of "HMIS HubSpot data sync" in messages and logs are updated to "PlotBox HubSpot data sync", indicating a renaming or re-focusing of the integration process from HMIS to PlotBox.
    *   **Update (11/6/2025, 4:25:18 PM):** The line `$this->plotBoxHubSpotService->syncPlotBoxData($this);` at the end of the `handle()` method is removed, which was causing the sync to run twice potentially.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\storage\logs\laravel-2025-11-06.log`**
    *   **Throughout the log:** Shows recurring `local.ERROR` messages related to "DB_ODBC_DRIVER" not being set properly, indicating connection issues for the `snowflake` or potentially `db2_ibmi_odbc` driver. These errors occur frequently between 10:14 AM and 10:15 AM.
    *   **Later entries:** Show `local.INFO: Fetching all locations from HubSpot` messages, suggesting that some parts of the HubSpot integration, possibly unrelated to PlotBox data fetching, are working. A `Psy\Exception\RuntimeException` occurs at 10:38:42 AM related to creating a PsySH runtime directory, possibly from a CLI tool.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contract.php`**
    *   **Initial state (11/6/2025, 4:20:01 PM):** Defines an Eloquent model for `Contract` connected to `snowflake` with table `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT`. Includes relationships to `Contact` and `ContractOwner`, scopes for update dates, and methods for retrieving living/deceased contacts.
    *   **Update (11/6/2025, 4:30:25 PM):** The `$table` property is updated to include the full schema path: `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT`.
    *   **Update (11/6/2025, 4:56:59 PM - 5:08:59 PM):** The table paths in the `$table` property and within the `belongsToMany` relationship are updated to `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.SNOWFLAKE_DB_SCHEMA=EVERSTORYPARTNERS_SHARED_SCHEMA.DIM_CONTRACT` (with an `=`). This seems to be an incorrect concatenation of the schema, which is then corrected to `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT` in the last log entry for this file, `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSEWAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT` (a typo).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\ContractOwner.php`**
    *   **Initial state (11/6/2025, 4:20:08 PM):** Defines an Eloquent model for `ContractOwner` connected to `snowflake` with table `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`. Includes relationships to `Contract` and `Contact` and scopes.
    *   **Update (11/6/2025, 4:30:46 PM):** The `$table` property is updated to include the full schema path: `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`.
    *   **Update (11/6/2025, 4:56:40 PM - 5:08:30 PM):** Similar to `Contact.php` and `Contract.php`, the `$table` property and the `belongsToMany` relationship are incorrectly updated to include `SNOWFLAKE_DB_SCHEMA=EVERSTORYPARTNERS_SHARED_SCHEMA` within the table name, then correctly updated to `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\Hmis\Sale.php`**
    *   **Single entry (11/6/2025, 5:24:38 PM):** Defines an Eloquent model for `Sale` connected to `sqlsrv`. Includes relationships and a complex `getDataWithDateRange` SQL query for fetching sales data, which explicitly joins multiple `Cafe` and `Name` tables. This model also has a `getHubspotData` method to retrieve data for today.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Repositories\EloquentHubSpotRepository.php`**
    *   **Initial state (11/6/2025, 5:15:41 PM):** Defines a `getDataForCrmSync` method that fetches data using the configured model and maps it to `HubSpotDataTransferObject`. This method defaults to `getDataWithDateRange` if no filter is provided.
    *   **Updates (11/6/2025, 5:20:08 PM - 5:27:28 PM):** The `getDataForCrmSync` method's default data retrieval path (`else { $hubspotData = $model->getDataWithDateRange(); }`) is changed to `else { $hubspotData = $model->getHubspotData(); }`, and then later wrapped in a `collect()` helper function. This indicates a change in the model's default data fetching method and ensures the result is always a Laravel collection.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **11/6/2025, 10:39:13 AM:** Introduction of `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot.
*   **11/6/2025, 10:47:23 AM:** `PlotBox\Contact.php` introduces `const CONNECTION = 'snowflake'`, formalizing the database connection.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:51:00 PM:** `PlotBox\Contact.php` significantly changes its raw SQL query in `getDataWithDateRange` from a CTE-based approach (handling both primary and deceased contacts) to a simpler direct join for *only* living contacts.
*   **11/6/2025, 4:21:23 PM:** The console command `PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand.php` is updated to consistently refer to "PlotBox HubSpot data sync" instead of "HMIS HubSpot data sync," indicating a shift in focus or clarification of the integration.
*   **11/6/2025, 4:45:48 PM:** The `.env` file explicitly defines `DB_ODBC_DRIVER` with a specific path, suggesting a resolution or attempt to fix the persistent ODBC driver errors seen in the logs.
*   **11/6/2025, 4:47:00 PM:** `.env` further defines `SNOWFLAKE_DB_DSN` with a complete ODBC connection string.
*   **11/6/2025, 4:50:13 PM:** `PlotBox\Contact.php` reverts `getDataWithDateRange` to a simpler `SELECT` query with a single date parameter, and introduces `getDataWithDateRange1` for the original CTE query, along with logging for query failures.
*   **11/6/2025, 5:03:53 PM - 5:11:05 PM:** `PlotBox\Contact.php` adjusts schema paths in SQL queries and introduces `getPlotBoxData` for default daily data retrieval.
*   **11/6/2025, 5:24:38 PM:** `Hmis\Sale.php` is introduced, defining HMIS-specific sales data retrieval logic.
*   **11/6/2025, 5:26:00 PM:** `PlotBox\Contact.php` updates `getDataForCrmSync` to use `getHubspotData()` as its default, aligning with the `EloquentHubSpotRepository` change.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Snowflake Integration:** A significant ongoing effort is observed in connecting to a Snowflake data warehouse, indicated by the `snowflake` connection configuration in `database.php` and its usage within the `PlotBox` models. There were initial struggles with ODBC driver configuration, evident from the log errors and subsequent `.env` updates.
2.  **HubSpot Data Sync:** The core task revolves around syncing data (initially "HMIS," later "PlotBox") to HubSpot. This involves a dedicated service (`PlotBoxHubSpotService`), a repository (`EloquentHubSpotRepository`), and console commands (`PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand`).
3.  **Data Retrieval Strategy Evolution:** In `PlotBox\Contact.php`, there's a back-and-forth on how data is fetched from the Snowflake database.
    *   Initially, complex SQL queries with CTEs are used.
    *   There's a shift to a simpler direct join query, specifically for non-deceased contacts.
    *   Later, the complex CTE query is retained (as `getDataWithDateRange1`), and the simpler one (`getDataWithDateRange`) is adapted for a single date parameter, potentially to resolve specific ODBC/performance issues or simplify a common use case.
    *   The schema naming in SQL queries also evolves, with changes from `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` to fully qualified `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS`.
4.  **Debugging & Logging:** Frequent use of `dd()` (dump and die) in console commands and `Log::error` in services/models indicates active debugging and error handling during development.
5.  **Environment Variable Reliance:** The application heavily relies on `.env` files for database credentials, API keys, and other configuration, as is typical in Laravel applications. The `DB_ODBC_DRIVER` error highlights the importance of correct environment setup.
6.  **Typographical Errors:** Some updates to table names or schema paths in the code (e.g., `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.SNOWFLAKE_DB_SCHEMA=EVERSTORYPARTNERS_SHARED_SCHEMA .DIM_CONTACT` or `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSEWAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT`) suggest manual editing and correction cycles.

## 7:15:02 PM
The provided log details code changes across several PHP files (`database.php`, `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, `Contact.php`, `Contract.php`, `ContractOwner.php`, `PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand.php`, `Sale.php`, `EloquentHubSpotRepository.php`) and a log file (`laravel-2025-11-06.log`). The changes primarily revolve around database connectivity, specifically with Snowflake, and a HubSpot data synchronization process.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\config\database.php`** (Multiple updates between 11/6/2025, 10:36:40 AM and 11/6/2025, 5:13:01 PM):
    *   This file configures various database connections for a Laravel application.
    *   There are no functional changes observed across the multiple timestamps for this file. The content remains largely identical, defining connections for `sqlite`, `laravel` (MySQL), `sims`, `corpstruct`, `keyserver`, `home_office`, `contract_margin` (all MySQL), `sqlsrv` (MSSQL), and `carlib` (DB2/IBM i Access ODBC).
    *   The `sqlsrv` connection is configured to connect to `CAFE-PROD-SQL1` with `STONEMOR_PROD` database.
    *   There are commented-out sections for `pgsql`, `odbc`, `pdo_odbc`, and `pdo_db2` drivers, indicating previous attempts or options for other database types.
    *   The repeated identical content suggests these timestamps might represent saving the file without changes, or changes that were reverted, or non-functional whitespace/comment changes not captured by the provided diff.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`** (Multiple updates between 11/6/2025, 10:39:13 AM and 11/6/2025, 5:19:52 PM):
    *   This service handles syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot.
    *   **10:39:13 AM**: Initial version of the service. It fetches data from a `hubSpotRepository` (which is configured to use `App\Models\PlotBox\Contact`) and iterates to sync contacts and deals. It includes a `dd($this->plotBoxData)` statement for debugging.
    *   **5:19:52 PM**: The content is identical to the 10:39:13 AM version, including the `dd($this->plotBoxData)` statement. This again suggests no functional change or a re-save.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`** (Multiple updates between 11/6/2025, 10:42:00 AM and 11/6/2025, 5:26:00 PM):
    *   This Eloquent model represents a `Contact` from the PlotBox system, backed by a Snowflake data warehouse.
    *   **Early Changes (10:42 AM - 10:47 AM)**:
        *   Initially, the `getDataWithDateRange` method used `DB::connection('fabric')->select(...)`.
        *   It was then changed to use `$this->connection` (10:43:28 AM), which implicitly refers to the protected `$connection` property.
        *   This was further refined to `self::$connection` (10:44:59 AM) and finally `self::CONNECTION` (10:47:23 AM) after `protected $connection` was changed to `const CONNECTION = 'snowflake'`. This ensures a consistent static reference to the Snowflake connection.
    *   **Later Changes (3:32 PM - 5:26 PM)**:
        *   The SQL query within `getDataWithDateRange` was modified multiple times.
        *   Initially, it included `AND DATE(LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC) = CURRENT_DATE()` (3:32:41 PM), then changed to `BETWEEN ? AND ?` matching the function parameters (3:33:31 PM).
        *   A significant change occurred around 3:51 PM, where the complex SQL query using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) (`WITH base_contracts AS (...)`) was commented out and replaced with a simpler `SELECT DISTINCT` query without CTEs. This simpler query was designed to fetch primary contacts, explicitly setting deceased contact fields to `NULL`. The new query also changed the `WHERE` clause to filter by `CAST(con.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN ? AND ?`.
        *   Further refinements to the SQL query at 3:53:36 PM involved adding `con.CONTRACT_KEY AS Contract_Key` to the select list and ordering by `Contract_Key`.
        *   At 3:57:23 PM, table names in the simpler SQL query were shortened (e.g., `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT` became `DIM_CONTRACT`), implying an expectation of the schema being set at the connection level or a qualified name being unnecessary.
        *   At 4:30:12 PM, the `$table` property was updated to include the full schema path: `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT`.
        *   The large CTE-based query was restored, replacing the simpler query, but with placeholders `{$fromDate}` and `{$toDate}` used directly in the string for `BETWEEN` clause, and an additional filter `AND CAST(pc.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN {$fromDate} AND {$toDate}` in the main `SELECT` statement (4:35:38 PM). This is a potential SQL injection vulnerability or format issue as dates should generally be passed as parameters.
        *   This direct string interpolation for dates was changed back to parameterized queries using `?` (4:34:31 PM) and then back to string interpolation with quotes `'{$fromDate}'` (4:37:46 PM).
        *   The `getDataWithDateRange` method was further refactored to use a simpler `SELECT` query *without* CTEs, specifically filtering by `DATE(con.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC) = ?` using only `$fromDate` and logging errors (4:49:44 PM). The original complex CTE query was moved to a new method `getDataWithDateRange1`.
        *   The hardcoded schema `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` in the simpler SQL query was fully qualified with `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE` at 5:03:53 PM.
        *   A new public method `getPlotBoxData()` was added at 5:21:55 PM, which calls `getDataWithDateRange` for today's date.
        *   The `getHmisData()` method was changed to `getHubspotData()` in the `getDataForCrmSync` method's `else` block at 5:24:46 PM.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Console\Commands\Integration\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand.php`** (Multiple updates between 11/6/2025, 3:29:13 PM and 11/6/2025, 4:25:18 PM):
    *   This is an Artisan command for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot.
    *   **3:29:13 PM**: Initial version, includes `dd($error)` in `sendErrorNotification`. References "HMIS HubSpot data sync".
    *   **3:29:34 PM**: Changes `dd($error)` to `dd($e)` in `sendErrorNotification`, focusing on the exception object for debugging.
    *   **4:15:36 PM**: Changes `dd($e)` to `dd($e->getMessage())` for a more concise debug output of the exception.
    *   **4:21:23 PM**: The command description and various log/info messages (`info()` and `Log::error()`) are updated to refer to "PlotBox HubSpot data sync" instead of "HMIS HubSpot data sync".
    *   **4:25:18 PM**: Removed the line `$this->plotBoxHubSpotService->syncPlotBoxData($this);` after the main `try-catch` block in `handle()`, meaning the sync logic is only executed within the `try` block.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\storage\logs\laravel-2025-11-06.log`** (Timestamp: 11/6/2025, 3:18:40 PM):
    *   This log file primarily shows repeated `local.ERROR` messages indicating that the `DB_ODBC_DRIVER` environment variable was not set properly.
    *   These errors occur multiple times between `10:14:23` and `10:15:29` on 2025-11-06, suggesting persistent issues with ODBC driver configuration for the `snowflake` connection.
    *   Later log entries (`10:37:22`, `10:37:30`, `10:38:40`) show `local.INFO: Fetching all locations from HubSpot`, indicating some HubSpot-related operations were successful or initiated.
    *   A `PsySH runtime directory` creation error is also logged at `10:38:42`, suggesting a potential local development environment issue with PHP's ability to write to temporary directories.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contract.php`** (Multiple updates between 11/6/2025, 4:20:01 PM and 11/6/2025, 5:08:59 PM):
    *   This model defines the `Contract` structure for PlotBox data, using the `snowflake` connection.
    *   **4:20:01 PM**: Initial creation of the model. Defines fillable fields, date casts, and relationships (many-to-many with `Contact` via `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`, and one-to-many with `ContractOwner`). Includes scopes for `updatedBetween`, `updatedToday`, and `withLivingContacts`.
    *   **4:30:25 PM**: The `$table` property was updated to `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT`, specifying the full schema and table name.
    *   **5:08:59 PM**: Minor change to `$table` property, mistakenly concatenating the schema: `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSEWAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT`. This is likely a typo. The `belongsToMany` relationship also had its schema modified, possibly incorrectly, to `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\ContractOwner.php`** (Multiple updates between 11/6/2025, 4:20:08 PM and 11/6/2025, 5:08:30 PM):
    *   This model represents the `ContractOwner` linking `Contract` and `Contact` models.
    *   **4:20:08 PM**: Initial creation. Defines fillable fields and `belongsTo` relationships for `contract` and `contact`. Includes scopes for `forContract` and `forContact`.
    *   **4:30:46 PM**: The `$table` property was updated to `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`.
    *   **5:08:30 PM**: The content is identical to the 4:30:46 PM version, suggesting no functional change or a re-save.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\Hmis\Sale.php`** (Timestamp: 11/6/2025, 5:24:38 PM):
    *   This model is for `Sale` data within an HMIS context, using the `sqlsrv` connection.
    *   Defines relationships to `Purchaser`, `SalesFinance`, `Location`, and `CafeCase`.
    *   Includes a complex SQL query in `getDataWithDateRange` that joins multiple tables (`Name`, `Sales_Finance`, `Location`, `CafeCase`, `CafeEmployee`, `CafeCasePerson`, `CafeArrangement`, `CafeArrangementService`) to fetch detailed sales and contact information.
    *   Filters sales based on `Sales_Status_Cd`, `Sales_Type_Cd`, `Location.Closed`, `Location.Sold`, `Sales_Finance.Balance_Due`, and `Sales.Last_Update_Dt`.
    *   Includes logic to parse `Addr_Line_1` and `Addr_Line_2` from `Primary_Street_Address`.
    *   A `getHubspotData()` method is provided to retrieve data for today.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Repositories\EloquentHubSpotRepository.php`** (Multiple updates between 11/6/2025, 5:15:41 PM and 11/6/2025, 5:27:28 PM):
    *   This repository fetches data for HubSpot CRM sync.
    *   **5:15:41 PM**: Initial version. It fetches data using the model's `getDataWithDateRange` method (or without arguments for default behavior) and maps it to `HubSpotDataTransferObject`. The DTO mapping explicitly lists many fields like `Unique_Key`, `Deceased_First_Name`, `Location_Cd`, `Primary_First_Name`, etc.
    *   **5:20:08 PM**: The content is identical to 5:15:41 PM.
    *   **5:26:41 PM**: The `else` block in `getDataForCrmSync` was updated from `$model->getDataWithDateRange()` to `$model->getHubspotData()`, indicating a change in how the default (today's) data is fetched by the model.
    *   **5:27:20 PM**: In the same `else` block, `getHubspotData()`'s result is explicitly wrapped in `collection()`: `collection($model->getHubspotData())`. This was then corrected at **5:27:28 PM** to `collect($model->getHubspotData())`.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **11/6/2025, 10:47:23 AM**: The `PlotBox\Contact` model standardizes its database connection reference to a class constant `self::CONNECTION`.
*   **11/6/2025, 3:29:13 PM - 4:21:23 PM**: The `PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand` undergoes several debugging-related changes (`dd()` calls) and a renaming of internal references from "HMIS HubSpot" to "PlotBox HubSpot".
*   **11/6/2025, 3:51:00 PM**: A major refactoring in `PlotBox\Contact`'s `getDataWithDateRange` to use a simpler SQL query without CTEs, likely to resolve issues.
*   **11/6/2025, 4:49:44 PM**: The `PlotBox\Contact` model separates the complex CTE query into `getDataWithDateRange1` and uses a simplified direct query for `getDataWithDateRange`, also changing the query logic to use a single date parameter with `WHERE DATE(...) = ?`.
*   **11/6/2025, 5:03:53 PM**: Full schema qualification added to table names in `PlotBox\Contact`'s simplified SQL query.
*   **11/6/2025, 5:21:55 PM**: Introduction of `getPlotBoxData()` method in `PlotBox\Contact` and a change in `getDataForCrmSync` to use `getHubspotData()` in `PlotBox\Contact` model.
*   **11/6/2025, 5:24:38 PM**: Introduction of `Hmis\Sale` model with a complex SQL query for fetching sales data.
*   **11/6/2025, 5:26:41 PM - 5:27:28 PM**: Adjustments in `EloquentHubSpotRepository` to correctly call the `getHubspotData()` method on the model and wrap its output in a Collection.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Database Connectivity Focus**: A significant portion of changes relates to configuring and querying various databases, especially MySQL, MSSQL, DB2, and Snowflake.
*   **HubSpot Integration**: There's a clear emphasis on integrating with HubSpot, particularly syncing contact and deal data from internal systems (HMIS, PlotBox).
*   **PlotBox Data Synchronization**: Numerous changes are dedicated to fetching and transforming PlotBox data for HubSpot, indicating an active development or debugging effort on this specific integration.
*   **Snowflake as Data Source**: The `PlotBox\Contact`, `PlotBox\Contract`, and `PlotBox\ContractOwner` models are explicitly configured to use the `snowflake` connection, drawing data from a data warehouse.
*   **SQL Query Iteration/Debugging**: The `PlotBox\Contact` model shows multiple iterations and commenting out of complex SQL queries, suggesting issues or performance tuning related to querying Snowflake. The shift from CTEs to simpler queries and back, along with parameter handling (`?` vs. direct string interpolation `{$var}`), indicates active debugging and refinement of the data retrieval logic.
*   **Debugging Statements**: The presence of `dd()` (dump and die) statements in the `PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand` and `PlotBox\Contact` `getDataWithDateRange` (via `Log::error`) indicates that the developers were actively debugging the data synchronization process.
*   **Environment Variable Usage**: Consistent use of `env()` in `config/database.php` for database credentials and other settings, highlighting a standard Laravel practice for managing configurations.
*   **Repetitive File Saves**: Multiple identical code blocks for `config/database.php` and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` suggest frequent saving or minor non-functional edits were made and logged.
*   **Error Logging**: The `laravel-2025-11-06.log` clearly shows recurring ODBC driver errors for Snowflake connections, which is a critical issue that the subsequent code changes seem to address (e.g., qualifying table names, simplifying queries in `Contact.php`).
*   **Schema Qualification**: There's an evolution in SQL queries and Eloquent table definitions to include full schema and database names (e.g., `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT`), likely in response to schema resolution issues with Snowflake.
