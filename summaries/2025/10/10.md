## 2:32:30 PM
The `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Hmis\HmisHubSpotService.php` file, last modified on 10/10/2025, 2:12:52 PM, implements a service responsible for synchronizing Hmis (Housing Management Information System) data to HubSpot CRM.

Key functionalities include:

*   **Data Retrieval and Mapping:** It fetches HMIS data using an `EloquentHubSpotRepository` and transforms this data into HubSpot-compatible formats for contacts (primary and deceased) and deals using an `HmisDataToCrmMapper`.
*   **Batch Processing:** The service collects HMIS data into batches for primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals, processing them efficiently.
*   **Service Type Differentiation:** It distinguishes between standard HMIS data and data with a `serviceTypeCode` of 'SHIPOUT', processing these two types separately in their respective batches.
*   **HubSpot Operations:**
    *   **Contacts:** It searches for existing primary and deceased contacts in HubSpot. If found, they are updated; otherwise, new contacts are created. A `sleep(10)` delay is included after processing primary contacts, likely to mitigate HubSpot API processing times.
    *   **Contact Merging:** It merges contact IDs by account number and then associates primary and deceased contacts within HubSpot.
    *   **Deals:** It searches for existing deals and either creates new ones or updates existing ones.
    *   **Associations:** Contacts and deals are associated with each other. Furthermore, primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals are associated with specific locations in HubSpot. A `sleep(1)` delay is used during location association to manage API rate limits.
*   **Robust Error Handling and Logging:** The `syncData` and `processContacts` methods are wrapped in `try-catch` blocks, providing detailed logging of errors, including messages, trace, file, and line numbers using `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log`.
*   **Dependency Injection:** The class is constructed with dependencies for HubSpot contact and deal services, promoting a modular and testable architecture.

In essence, this file orchestrates a complex data synchronization workflow from an internal system to HubSpot, meticulously handling contact and deal management, associations, and API interaction constraints.
