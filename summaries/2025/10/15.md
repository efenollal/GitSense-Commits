The provided code changes highlight updates to a Laravel Eloquent model for sales data retrieval and the introduction of a new HubSpot CRM integration service.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\Hmis\Sale.php`**:
    *   Initially, at `10/14/2025, 8:49:01 PM` and `10/14/2025, 8:52:26 PM`, this file defines the `Sale` Eloquent model. It establishes `belongsTo` relationships with `Name`, `Location`, and `CafeCase`, and a `hasOne` relationship with `SalesFinance`. The `getHmisData()` method contains a comprehensive SQL query involving multiple joins (e.g., `Name`, `Sales_Finance`, `Location`, `CafeCase`, `CafeEmployee`, `Name2` for deceased info, `CafeCasePerson`, `CafeArrangement`, `CafeArrangementService`) to select various fields related to sales, purchasers, and deceased individuals. This query filters sales based on status (`New`, `Open`), type (`AN_FH`, `AN_MISC`, `ATNEED`), location status (not closed or sold), and a non-zero balance due. Crucially, the initial version of the query filtered `Sales.Last_Update_Dt` for a hardcoded date of `'2025-09-12'`.
    *   A subsequent change at `10/14/2025, 9:02:04 PM` updated the `getHmisData()` method. The `whereRaw` clause for `Sales.Last_Update_Dt` was modified to use `now()->toDateString()` instead of the fixed '2025-09-12', making the data retrieval dynamic to the current date.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotContactService.php`**:
    *   At `10/14/2025, 9:00:23 PM`, a new service class, `HubSpotContactService`, was introduced. This service is responsible for interacting with the HubSpot CRM for contact management. It includes methods for:
        *   `createContact`: To create new contacts in HubSpot, removing specific properties (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `service_type_code`) before sending data and providing detailed error logging for individual failures.
        *   `updateContact`: To update existing contacts in HubSpot, similarly cleaning properties and logging updates/failures.
        *   `associatePrimaryAndDeceasedContacts`: To establish bidirectional "Next of Kin" associations between primary and deceased contacts within HubSpot, utilizing configurable association type IDs and including robust error handling. The service initializes with HubSpot API access token and association type IDs loaded from configuration.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **`10/14/2025, 9:00:23 PM`**: Introduction of the `HubSpotContactService`, indicating a new CRM integration feature.
*   **`10/14/2025, 9:02:04 PM`**: Modification in `Sale.php` to dynamically filter sales data by the current date, improving the flexibility of the `getHmisData()` method.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**

*   **Date Dynamization**: A clear pattern observed in `Sale.php` is the transition from hardcoded dates to dynamic date functions (e.g., `now()->toDateString()`) for data filtering, suggesting a move towards more current and automated data processing.
*   **External API Integration Design**: The `HubSpotContactService` demonstrates a consistent pattern for integrating with external APIs:
    *   Dependency injection for API client initialization.
    *   Configuration-driven parameters (access tokens, association IDs).
    *   Pre-processing of data (removing internal/irrelevant properties) before sending to the external system.
    *   Comprehensive logging for success, API-specific errors, and general exceptions.
    *   Resilience in error handling, allowing processing to continue for other items even if one fails.
    *   Clear separation of concerns into distinct methods for creating, updating, and associating records.
*   **Complex SQL Query Construction**: The `getHmisData` method in `Sale.php` showcases the use of multiple `join` clauses and `DB::raw()` expressions to construct a detailed SQL query, indicating a need to aggregate data from various interconnected tables within the HMIS database.
