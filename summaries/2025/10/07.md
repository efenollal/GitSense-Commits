# Activity Summary for 10/7/2025

## 1:45:37 PM
The `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\HmisDataToCrmMapper.php` file underwent a specific update on 10/7/2025.

**Initial State (10/7/2025, 1:38:08 PM):**
The `HmisDataToCrmMapper` class is responsible for transforming HMIS data into a format suitable for HubSpot CRM, specifically for Contacts, Deceased Contacts, and Deals. Key features include:
- Integration with HubSpot services for owners and locations.
- Constructor initializes HubSpot configuration values like lifecycle stages and pipeline names.
- Methods `mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, and `mapDeal` handle the mapping logic for different entity types, extracting and trimming data from a `HubSpotDataTransferObject`.
- A private `formatMappedFields` method centralizes common data transformations:
    - Looking up `loc_id` and `hubspot_owner_id` using helper methods.
    - Uppercasing the `state` field.
    - Standardizing the `pipeline` value based on a condition (`an_fh`).
    - The `relationship_to_the_deceased` field was directly assigned the trimmed input value.
    - A default case applies `ucwords(strtolower($value))` to other fields.
- Date fields are converted to epoch or midnight UTC milliseconds using helper functions.
- HubSpot owner IDs are constructed using the pattern `[dealOwnerUserName]@everstorypartners.com`.
- The class caches owner lists and all locations from HubSpot to optimize lookups.

**Update (10/7/2025, 1:43:46 PM):**
A minor but significant change was introduced to standardize the `relationship_to_the_deceased` field.
- A new class constant `const RELATIONSHIP_TO_THE_DECEASED = 'Next of Kin';` was added to the `HmisDataToCrmMapper` class.
- The `formatMappedFields` method was modified: the `case 'relationship_to_the_the_deceased':` now assigns `self::RELATIONSHIP_TO_THE_DECEASED` to the `$value`, effectively hardcoding "Next of Kin" for this field during formatting, overriding any original input.
- A comment was added to the `mapContact` method next to the `relationship_to_the_deceased` field, indicating that it "will be replaced with a constant value" (referring to the `formatMappedFields` logic).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
- **Data Sanitization:** Consistent use of `trim()` on almost all incoming data points from the DTO.
- **HubSpot Integration:** Extensive use of HubSpot-specific fields, services, and configuration values (e.g., `lifecyclestage`, `pipeline`, `dealstage`).
- **Standardization:** A dedicated `formatMappedFields` method is used to apply common formatting rules and lookups (e.g., uppercasing, ID lookups, specific value assignments).
- **Date Conversion:** Regular application of `convert_utc_date_to_epoch` and `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` for date-related properties.
- **Owner Email Format:** The pattern `[username]@everstorypartners.com` is consistently used for constructing owner emails.
- **Caching:** The class pre-fetches and caches HubSpot owners and locations for efficiency.

The log details changes related to a data synchronization process from an HMIS (Hospital Management Information System) to HubSpot CRM, primarily focusing on contacts and deals.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\HmisDataToCrmMapper.php`**:
    *   The file defines a `HmisDataToCrmMapper` class responsible for transforming HMIS data into HubSpot-compatible formats for primary contacts, deceased contacts, and sales deals.
    *   It includes methods (`mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, `mapDeal`) that extract and format various fields such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email, account numbers, dates (birth, death, update, sale), religious affiliation, and service types.
    *   A helper method `formatMappedFields` standardizes `loc_id`, `state`, `relationship_to_the_deceased`, `pipeline`, and `hubspot_owner_id` values.
    *   It leverages `HubSpotOwnerService` and `HubSpotLocationService` to retrieve necessary IDs for mapping.
    *   HubSpot lifecycle stages, deal stages, and pipelines are configured via `config('services.hubspot...')`.
    *   Initial entry at 10/7/2025, 1:46:25 PM established the core mapping logic. Subsequent entries at 1:49:06 PM and 1:50:21 PM show no functional changes, indicating potential re-saves or minor non-functional edits.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\Hmis\Sale.php`**:
    *   This file contains an Eloquent model for `Sale` that interacts with an `sqlsrv` database. It defines relationships to `Name`, `SalesFinance`, `Location`, and `CafeCase` models.
    *   The `getHmisData` method constructs a complex SQL query to retrieve comprehensive sales, purchaser, deceased, and location information, including logic to parse street addresses into two lines.
    *   Filters are applied based on sales status ('New', 'Open'), sales type ('AN_FH', 'AN_MISC', 'ATNEED'), active locations, and non-zero balance due.
    *   Initially (10/7/2025, 1:46:57 PM), the query included a hardcoded date filter: `->whereRaw("CAST(Sales.Last_Update_Dt as date) = ?",'2025-09-04')`.
    *   A significant update at 10/7/2025, 1:48:34 PM changed this hardcoded date to a dynamic one: `->whereRaw("CAST(Sales.Last_Update_Dt as date) = ?", now()->toDateString())`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Hmis\HmisHubSpotService.php`**:
    *   This service orchestrates the end-to-end synchronization process. It uses the `HmisDataToCrmMapper` and interacts with `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, and `HubSpotLocationService`.
    *   The `syncData` method retrieves HMIS data, batches it, and processes it into primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals. It segregates processing for 'SHIPOUT' service types.
    *   The `processContacts` private method handles searching for existing contacts/deals in HubSpot, then creating or updating them. It includes a 10-second `sleep` call after processing primary contacts before processing deceased contacts, likely to accommodate HubSpot's processing time.
    *   It merges contact IDs by account, associates primary and deceased contacts, associates deals with contacts, and associates contacts and deals with locations.
    *   The initial version (10/7/2025, 1:47:24 PM) contained a debugging statement `dd($primaryContactBatch);`.
    *   This debugging statement was removed in the subsequent update (10/7/2025, 1:48:28 PM), indicating a transition from testing to a more operational state.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **10/7/2025, 1:46:57 PM**: The `Sale` model's `getHmisData` query was defined with a hardcoded `Last_Update_Dt` filter, suggesting an initial testing or specific data retrieval scenario.
*   **10/7/2025, 1:47:24 PM**: The core `HmisHubSpotService` for synchronization was implemented, including batching and a temporary `dd()` debugging call.
*   **10/7/2025, 1:48:28 PM**: The `dd()` debugging statement was removed from `HmisHubSpotService.php`, indicating a step towards production readiness.
*   **10/7/2025, 1:48:34 PM**: The `Sale` model's query was updated to use a dynamic date filter (`now()->toDateString()`), signifying a shift to real-time or daily data synchronization for records updated on the current day.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **HMIS to HubSpot Data Flow**: A clear pattern of extracting data from an HMIS database, transforming it, and synchronizing it with HubSpot CRM (contacts, deals, locations).
*   **Separation of Concerns**: The architecture uses distinct classes for mapping (`HmisDataToCrmMapper`), data retrieval (`Sale` model's `getHmisData` via `EloquentHubSpotRepository`), and orchestration of synchronization (`HmisHubSpotService`).
*   **Batch Processing and Error Handling**: Data is consistently processed in batches for efficiency, and all services include robust `try-catch` blocks and logging for error management.
*   **Data Standardization**: Extensive use of `trim()`, `strtoupper()`, `strtolower()`, `ucwords()`, and custom date conversion functions for data consistency before sending to HubSpot.
*   **Configuration-Driven Values**: HubSpot-specific attributes like lifecycle stages and pipelines are fetched from application configuration, promoting flexibility and easier updates.
*   **Lifecycle of Development**: The presence and subsequent removal of hardcoded values and debugging statements illustrate a typical development cycle, moving from specific testing to generalized production functionality.
