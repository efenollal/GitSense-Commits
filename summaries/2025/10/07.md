# Activity Summary for 10/7/2025

## 1:45:37 PM
The `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\HmisDataToCrmMapper.php` file underwent a specific update on 10/7/2025.

**Initial State (10/7/2025, 1:38:08 PM):**
The `HmisDataToCrmMapper` class is responsible for transforming HMIS data into a format suitable for HubSpot CRM, specifically for Contacts, Deceased Contacts, and Deals. Key features include:
- Integration with HubSpot services for owners and locations.
- Constructor initializes HubSpot configuration values like lifecycle stages and pipeline names.
- Methods `mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, and `mapDeal` handle the mapping logic for different entity types, extracting and trimming data from a `HubSpotDataTransferObject`.
- A private `formatMappedFields` method centralizes common data transformations:
    - Looking up `loc_id` and `hubspot_owner_id` using helper methods.
    - Uppercasing the `state` field.
    - Standardizing the `pipeline` value based on a condition (`an_fh`).
    - The `relationship_to_the_deceased` field was directly assigned the trimmed input value.
    - A default case applies `ucwords(strtolower($value))` to other fields.
- Date fields are converted to epoch or midnight UTC milliseconds using helper functions.
- HubSpot owner IDs are constructed using the pattern `[dealOwnerUserName]@everstorypartners.com`.
- The class caches owner lists and all locations from HubSpot to optimize lookups.

**Update (10/7/2025, 1:43:46 PM):**
A minor but significant change was introduced to standardize the `relationship_to_the_deceased` field.
- A new class constant `const RELATIONSHIP_TO_THE_DECEASED = 'Next of Kin';` was added to the `HmisDataToCrmMapper` class.
- The `formatMappedFields` method was modified: the `case 'relationship_to_the_the_deceased':` now assigns `self::RELATIONSHIP_TO_THE_DECEASED` to the `$value`, effectively hardcoding "Next of Kin" for this field during formatting, overriding any original input.
- A comment was added to the `mapContact` method next to the `relationship_to_the_deceased` field, indicating that it "will be replaced with a constant value" (referring to the `formatMappedFields` logic).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
- **Data Sanitization:** Consistent use of `trim()` on almost all incoming data points from the DTO.
- **HubSpot Integration:** Extensive use of HubSpot-specific fields, services, and configuration values (e.g., `lifecyclestage`, `pipeline`, `dealstage`).
- **Standardization:** A dedicated `formatMappedFields` method is used to apply common formatting rules and lookups (e.g., uppercasing, ID lookups, specific value assignments).
- **Date Conversion:** Regular application of `convert_utc_date_to_epoch` and `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` for date-related properties.
- **Owner Email Format:** The pattern `[username]@everstorypartners.com` is consistently used for constructing owner emails.
- **Caching:** The class pre-fetches and caches HubSpot owners and locations for efficiency.
