# Activity Summary for 10/14/2025

## 9:43:06 AM
The `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotContactService.php` file, last modified on `10/14/2025, 9:28:16 AM`, outlines a service for interacting with the HubSpot CRM specifically for contact management.

Key updates and functionalities include:

*   **HubSpot API Integration:** The service initializes a HubSpot client using an access token and retrieves specific association type IDs from configuration, indicating a robust integration.
*   **Contact Creation (`createContact`):** This method iterates through an array of contacts, preparing and sending them to HubSpot. It includes logic to filter out specific properties like `loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, and `service_type_code` before creating the contact. Extensive logging and error handling are implemented, allowing the process to continue even if individual contact creations fail.
*   **Contact Update (`updateContact`):** Similar to creation, this method handles updating existing contacts in HubSpot. It requires a `hubspot_id` for each contact and applies the same property filtering logic (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `service_type_code`) before performing the update. Error handling ensures that failures for one contact do not halt the entire update process.
*   **Contact Association (`associatePrimaryAndDeceasedContacts`):** A distinct feature allows for creating two-way associations between 'primary' and 'deceased' contacts within HubSpot, using a user-defined association type ID configured in the system. This method also features individual error handling and logging for each association attempt.
*   **Property Filtering Pattern:** A recurring pattern across both `createContact` and `updateContact` methods is the explicit removal of `loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, and `service_type_code` properties from contact data before sending it to HubSpot. This suggests a consistent data transformation requirement for HubSpot.
*   **Robust Error Handling and Logging:** All major operations (`create`, `update`, `associate`) include comprehensive `try-catch` blocks to manage HubSpot API exceptions (`ContactsApiException`) and general exceptions. Detailed `Log::info` and `Log::error` statements are used to track progress and identify failures, including relevant context like account numbers, categories, and response bodies, making the service resilient and debuggable.
*   **Planned Functionality:** The presence of a truncated `searchForContacts` method indicates an intention to implement contact search capabilities within the service.
