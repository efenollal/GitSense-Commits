The file `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Console\Commands\Integration\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotSyncDataCommand.php`, last modified on `10/24/2025, 6:27:27 PM`, introduces a new Laravel console command named `hub:plotbox-hubspot-data-push`.

This command is designed to synchronize data between PlotBox and HubSpot, leveraging views from a Microsoft Fabric data warehouse.

Key updates and functionalities include:

*   **Microsoft Fabric Integration:** The command heavily relies on the `App\SMCore\Services\MSFabric\FabricWarehouseService` to interact with the Microsoft Fabric data warehouse. This service is used for testing connections, retrieving warehouse metadata, listing available views, inspecting view columns, and querying data.
*   **Command Options for Inspection and Debugging:**
    *   `--test-connection`: Verifies the connection to Microsoft Fabric and displays connection statistics like server, database, and user information, along with available tables and views.
    *   `--list-views`: Lists all detected views within the Fabric warehouse, grouped by schema, and provides hints for further inspection and querying.
    *   `--inspect-view=[schema.view_name]`: Provides detailed information about a specific view, including its column names, data types, nullability, maximum length, total record count, and a sample of the first three records.
    *   `--view=[schema.view_name]`: Specifies a particular view to query data from during the sync process.
*   **Core Data Sync Logic:**
    *   The `handle` method orchestrates the sync, first querying the Fabric data warehouse (defaulting to `dbo.syncobj_0x3030303630334538` or using the specified `--view`).
    *   It includes a fallback mechanism to query `dbo.Supplier_Type` if the initial view query fails.
    *   Retrieved data is processed for HubSpot synchronization, involving transformation of record fields (e.g., extracting first and last names from a full name) into a HubSpot-compatible format.
*   **HubSpot Integration Placeholder:** The `syncToHubSpot` method currently serves as a placeholder, logging the data being "synced" but not performing actual API calls. It suggests the future use of a `HubSpotService` to create or update contacts.
*   **Error Handling:** Extensive `try-catch` blocks are implemented to manage exceptions during Fabric interactions and the overall sync process, providing informative error messages and stack traces.

The command demonstrates a pattern of integrating external data warehouses (Microsoft Fabric) with CRM platforms (HubSpot) via a custom Laravel console command, providing robust introspection and debugging capabilities alongside the core data processing and synchronization logic.
