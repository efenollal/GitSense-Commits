# Activity Summary for 2/21/2026

## 3:03:04 AM
The code changes primarily revolve around an integration between a "PlotBox" data source (likely a data warehouse using Snowflake) and the HubSpot CRM, focusing on contact and deal synchronization.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotContactService.php`**
    *   **2/18/2026, 2:09:54 PM**: This initial version defined a service for managing HubSpot contacts. It included methods for `createContact`, `updateContact`, and `associatePrimaryAndDeceasedContacts`. Key features included:
        *   Removing specific properties (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `service_type_code`) before sending data to HubSpot for both creation and updates.
        *   Robust error handling with detailed logging for failed contact creations and updates, allowing the process to continue for other contacts.
        *   Creating reciprocal associations between "primary" and "deceased" contacts using a configurable `next_of_kin_contact_association_type_id`.
    *   **2/18/2026, 2:23:45 PM & 2:26:13 PM**: Minor temporary debugging statements (`dd($property);`, `dd($contactProperties);`) were introduced in the `updateContact` method, likely to inspect data flow during development or issue resolution.
    *   **2/18/2026, 2:27:29 PM**: A functional correction was applied in the `updateContact` method. The `foreach` loop iterating over `$contactProperties` was changed from `foreach ($contactProperties as $property)` to `foreach ($contactProperties as $key => $property)` to correctly access and `unset` properties by their key, along with the removal of the debugging `dd()` statements. This fixes a potential bug in how properties were being removed.
    *   **2/18/2026, 2:28:48 PM**: A minor logging improvement was made in the `associatePrimaryAndDeceasedContacts` method's completion log message.
    *   **2/18/2026, 2:30:15 PM**: No discernible changes were observed, indicating a minor save or an identical state to the previous timestamp.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **2/18/2026, 2:13:00 PM**: This file defines a Laravel Eloquent model for a `DIM_CONTACT` table in a Snowflake warehouse. It includes:
        *   Basic model setup with fillable fields and relationships (`contractOwners`, `contracts`).
        *   A complex static method `getDataWithDateRange` which executes a large SQL query involving multiple CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to gather comprehensive contact, contract, financial, and item ownership data (e.g., caskets, cremation products, mausoleums) from various PlotBox warehouse tables.
        *   The query primarily filters data based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within a specified date range, with an optional "Approved" status filter for production environments.
    *   **2/18/2026, 2:29:45 PM**: No discernible changes were observed.
    *   **2/19/2026, 9:09:56 AM**: A temporary change was made in the `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query. The original date range filtering logic was commented out and replaced with a hardcoded `WHERE` clause: `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '278-1004010610'`. This was likely for testing or debugging a specific contract.
    *   **2/19/2026, 9:24:34 AM**: The hardcoded `WHERE` clause was removed, and the original date range filtering logic was uncommented, reverting the SQL query to its intended functional state.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **2/19/2026, 9:10:28 AM**: This file defines the core service for orchestrating the PlotBox-to-HubSpot data synchronization.
        *   It injects `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, and `HubSpotLocationService` instances.
        *   The `syncPlotBoxData` method retrieves PlotBox data using a repository, maps it to HubSpot-compatible structures, and then calls `processContacts`.
        *   A `dd($primaryContactBatch);` debugging statement was present early in the `syncPlotBoxData` method, indicating a breakpoint for inspection.
        *   The `processContacts` method manages the end-to-end sync process, including:
            *   Sequential processing of primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals (searching, creating, updating).
            *   Creating associations between contacts, and then between contacts and deals, and finally between contacts/deals and locations.
            *   It includes `sleep()` calls between major processing steps (e.g., after primary contacts, after deceased contacts, after deals) which is a common practice to respect API rate limits or allow for backend processing.
            *   Extensive logging and individual `try-catch` blocks for each major processing step (contacts, deals, various associations) ensure resilience, allowing the sync to continue even if one part fails.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **2/18/2026, 2:27:29 PM**: A critical functional fix in `HubSpotContactService.php` for correctly unsetting properties during contact updates.
*   **2/19/2026, 9:09:56 AM**: Temporary modification in `PlotBox\Contact.php` to hardcode a specific contract number for data retrieval, indicating focused debugging.
*   **2/19/2026, 9:24:34 AM**: Reversion of the temporary change in `PlotBox\Contact.php`, restoring the date range filtering.
*   **2/19/2026, 9:10:28 AM**: Introduction of `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, outlining the complete data synchronization workflow with debugging points and robust error handling.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging Practices**: Frequent use of `dd()` (dump and die) statements, particularly in the `HubSpotContactService` and `PlotBoxHubSpotService` files during the 2/18/2026 timestamp range, and a temporary hardcoded filter in `PlotBox\Contact.php` on 2/19/2026, indicates active and iterative debugging.
*   **Robust Error Handling and Logging**: All service files consistently employ `try-catch` blocks and detailed `Log::info` and `Log::error` messages to ensure that processing failures are captured without halting the entire synchronization, and to provide clear visibility into the process.
*   **Data Transformation/Filtering**: The `HubSpotContactService` consistently filters out specific properties (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `service_type_code`) before sending data to HubSpot, suggesting these are internal fields not meant for the CRM.
*   **Associations-Centric Logic**: A significant portion of the HubSpot services is dedicated to establishing various associations (primary-deceased contacts, contact-deal, contact-location, deal-location), highlighting the importance of connected data within the CRM.
*   **API Rate Limit/Timing Management**: The inclusion of `sleep()` calls in `PlotBoxHubSpotService` between different HubSpot API operations points to a strategy for managing API rate limits or ensuring that HubSpot's backend has sufficient time to process records before subsequent operations depend on them.
*   **Snowflake as Data Source**: The `PlotBox\Contact` model's `getDataWithDateRange` method demonstrates a complex SQL query targeting a Snowflake warehouse, indicating it's the primary data source for the CRM sync.

## 3:03:25 AM
The development log primarily details work on Paymentus integration, focusing on CSV export, data modeling, and SFTP file handling.

### File-Specific Updates:

**1. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Services\Paymentus\CsvExporter.php`**
- **Initial Development (2/19/2026, 9:28 AM - 1:49 PM):** The `CsvExporter` class was initially set up to export Paymentus data to CSV files. Early changes involved refining CSV headers, transitioning from `snake_case` (e.g., `account_number`) to `PascalCase` (e.g., `AccountNumber`), and removing/commenting out the `status` and `InvoiceId` fields, replacing the latter with `InvoiceNumber`. Date formats for `NEXT_EXPECTED_PAYMENT_DATE` and `max_posting_date` were adjusted from `Y-m-d` to `Ymd`.
- **Header Standardization & Mapping Refinements (2/19/2026, 2:07 PM - 2:44 PM):** Headers like `Auth1PhoneCell` were renamed to more descriptive `'Authentication token1'`. There was a brief attempt to introduce a `PhoneNumber` class for formatting, which was quickly corrected to a local `formatPhoneNumbers` method, and then the use of this method in `mapRecordToRow` was reverted. Null coalescing (`?? ''`) was added for date formatting fields (`max_posting_date`, `NEXT_EXPECTED_PAYMENT_DATE`) to ensure empty strings instead of nulls. Several fields in `mapRecordToRow` were explicitly set to empty strings or 'N', indicating a decision to provide default or placeholder values for certain output columns.
- **Logging & Debugging Enhancements (2/19/2026, 3:00 PM - 3:05 PM):** Significant effort was made to enhance logging within the `writeChunk` method. A `totalRecordsWritten` counter was introduced, and detailed `Log::debug` messages were added to track individual record mappings, including raw contract, facility, primary owner, contact, and computed values. The `writeChunk` logic was refactored to iterate over records and build an array of mapped rows (`$mappedRecords`) before inserting them into the CSV. An `exit;` statement was temporarily introduced within `writeChunk` at several points for debugging.
- **Final Mapping Adjustments (2/19/2026, 5:22 PM - 6:40 PM):**
    - The `exit;` debugging statements were removed from `writeChunk`, except for some instances that appear as lingering debugging.
    - The `PaymentType` field was set to a hardcoded 'VCCC'.
    - Date formats for `DueDate` and `MaxPostingDate` were changed to `mdY` and later to `m/d/Y`.
    - `formatPhoneNumbers` method was eventually removed from the class, indicating phone number formatting moved elsewhere.
    - CSV headers for phone numbers changed from generic `Mobile`, `Landline` to more specific `Day Phone`, `Day Ext`, `Evening Phone`, `Evening Ext`, with corresponding mapping adjustments.
    - Header names were further refined to include spaces (e.g., `AccountNumber` to `Account Number`) and slashes (`StateProvince` to `State/Province`, `ZipPostalCode` to `Zip/Postal Code`). A `Max Posting Date2` header was added, mapped to an empty string.

**2. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContact.php`**
- **Phone Number Formatting (2/19/2026, 2:31 PM - 6:31 PM):** Initially, a `mobileNumber()` mutator was added to strip non-digit characters from the mobile number when saved. This was renamed to `mobile()` and then changed to an accessor, applying the formatting when the attribute is retrieved. Later, a `landline()` accessor was added with identical phone number formatting logic. This centralizes phone number formatting for consistency.

**3. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusData.php`**
- **Export Process & Debugging (2/19/2026, 2:38 PM - 3:02 PM):** This action orchestrates the Paymentus data export. Initial commits included a `dd($v);` statement for debugging. Later, this was replaced with accumulating all records into an `$allRecords` collection and a detailed `Log::info` entry logging the total count and a JSON representation of key record data. An `exit;` statement was briefly added and then commented out for debugging.

**4. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContract.php`**
- **Model Definition & Export Scope (2/19/2026, 6:14 PM):** A comprehensive `DimContract` Eloquent model was defined, including database connection, table, primary key, and `casts` for boolean and date fields. It established various relationships (`facility`, `contractOwners`, `payments`, `paymentSchedules`, `primaryContractOwner`, `currentPaymentScheduleDetail`). A `scopeForAccountExport` query scope was added to filter contracts based on several criteria (e.g., not deleted, not in 'Submitted'/'Draft' status, not paid in full, positive `INSTALLMENT_AMOUNT`). Several computed attribute accessors (`amountPastDue`, `amountDue`, `minAmountDue`, `maxAmountDue`, `daysPastDue`, `maxPostingDate`, `stateAbbreviation`, `system`) were implemented to derive values needed for the Paymentus export CSV. Minor, non-functional reordering of `limit` and `orderByRaw` in the export scope was observed.

**5. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\UploadToSftp.php`**
- **SFTP Upload Logic (2/19/2026, 6:16 PM - 2/20/2026, 4:51 PM):** This action handles uploading files to an SFTP server. It includes logging for process start, success, and error handling. It was initially configured to upload to a generic 'sftp' disk but was later changed to target a specific 'paymentus_sftp' disk. Repeated `dd($fileContents);` statements indicate persistent debugging of the file content before upload.

**6. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\DataTransferObjects\Paymentus\ContractRecord.php`**
- **DTO Definition (2/20/2026, 2:34 PM):** A `ContractRecord` Data Transfer Object (DTO) was created as a `readonly` class. It defines a structured set of public properties corresponding to the expected fields in the Paymentus CSV, including account details, amounts, dates (as Carbon objects), authentication tokens, personal information, address, and channel blocking statuses. Multiple rapid saves without functional changes indicate iterative definition.

**7. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\ParseContractFile.php`**
- **CSV Parsing for Contracts (2/20/2026, 2:43 PM - 3:16 PM):** This action was developed to parse incoming Paymentus CIF CSV files. It includes robust file handling (opening, reading headers, row-by-row processing), error logging for malformed rows, and a `mapRowToContractRecord` method to convert CSV data into `ContractRecord` DTOs. A private `parseDate` helper method was implemented to handle date strings formatted as `mdY`. Numerous identical commits suggest frequent saving.

**8. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\ParsePaymentFile.php`**
- **CSV Parsing for Payments (2/20/2026, 3:17 PM):** This action was introduced for parsing Paymentus payment files, closely mirroring the structure and logic of `ParseContractFile.php` for handling CSV input, mapping data to a `PaymentRecord` DTO (structurally similar to `ContractRecord`), and including `parseDate` functionality.

**9. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\FetchSftpPaymentFile.php`**
- **SFTP File Retrieval (2/20/2026, 3:41 PM):** This action was added to fetch the latest payment file from an SFTP server. It scans a specified directory, filters files by a pattern, sorts them to identify the latest, retrieves its contents, and saves it to a unique temporary local path. Comprehensive logging is included for each step.

**10. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\filesystems.php`**
- **Filesystem Configuration (2/20/2026, 4:50 PM - 4:51 PM):** New filesystem disk configurations were added:
    - `paymentus`: A local disk for storing outgoing Paymentus CSV files.
    - `plotbox_sftp`: An SFTP disk for PlotBox integrations, with configurable host, credentials, port, and root path from environment variables.
    - `paymentus_sftp`: A dedicated SFTP disk for Paymentus uploads, also configurable via environment variables.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:
- **Iterative Development and Debugging:** There's a clear pattern of iterative development, marked by frequent saves without functional changes, and the repeated introduction/removal of `dd()` and `exit;` statements in core actions and services. This indicates active, real-time debugging during the development process.
- **CSV Header and Mapping Evolution:** The Paymentus CSV export format underwent significant evolution in `CsvExporter.php`, with multiple changes to header names, their casing, and how data fields are mapped from source records. This suggests an ongoing process of aligning with external system requirements.
- **Centralized Formatting and Data Structures:** The introduction of attribute accessors in `DimContact.php` for phone number formatting and the creation of `ContractRecord.php` DTOs highlight a move towards more structured, type-safe, and centralized data handling and transformation within the application.
- **SFTP Integration:** A consistent focus on SFTP interactions is evident with the development of specific actions for fetching and uploading files, complemented by detailed filesystem configurations for different SFTP endpoints (PlotBox, Paymentus).
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Throughout the relevant files, `Log::info` and `Log::debug` calls are extensively used to trace the execution flow, data parsing, and record mapping, indicating a strong emphasis on observability and troubleshooting.

## 4:03:00 AM
The `HubSpotContactService.php` file saw iterative updates on 2/18/2026. Initially, it defined methods for creating, updating, and associating contacts in HubSpot. Key functionalities included stripping certain properties (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `service_type_code`) before sending data to HubSpot and robust error logging for individual contact operations, allowing the process to continue despite failures. A significant change occurred at 2:27:29 PM when a bug in the `updateContact` method's property removal logic was fixed, correcting the iteration over properties to use the key for unsetting (`foreach ($contactProperties as $key => $property)`). Prior timestamps at 2:23:45 PM and 2:26:13 PM show intermediate debugging steps (`dd($property);`, `dd($contactProperties);`) within this method that were later removed. Subsequent changes at 2:28:48 PM and 2:30:15 PM involved minor adjustments to logging messages for the completion of the association process.

The `PlotBox\Contact.php` file, which represents a data model for PlotBox contacts from a Snowflake warehouse, had changes spanning 2/18/2026 and 2/19/2026. The initial version at 2:13:00 PM contained a complex SQL query in the `getDataWithDateRange` method to retrieve detailed contact and contract information, including derived values like total tax, net price, and counts of various owned items, distinguishing between primary and deceased contacts. This query also included a `contractStatusFilter` for production environments. At 2:19/2026, 9:09:56 AM, the `getDataWithDateRange` method was temporarily modified for debugging, commenting out the original date range filtering and adding a hardcoded filter for a specific contract number (`DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '278-1004010610'`). This debugging change was then reverted at 9:24:34 AM, restoring the original date range and `EXISTS` clause filtering.

The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` file, first logged on 2/19/2026, 9:10:28 AM, provides the orchestration logic for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot. It integrates with `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, and `HubSpotLocationService`. Its `syncPlotBoxData` method fetches data, maps it to HubSpot formats for primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals, and then calls `processContacts`. The `processContacts` method is designed for resilience, wrapping each major step (primary contacts, deceased contacts, contact associations, deals, location associations) in individual `try-catch` blocks with extensive logging, ensuring that failures in one area do not halt the entire sync. It also incorporates `sleep()` calls, likely to manage API rate limits or allow HubSpot time to process previous requests. A `dd($primaryContactBatch);` statement was present in the `syncPlotBoxData` method at this timestamp, indicating an active debugging phase.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HubSpot API Interaction:** All changes primarily revolve around interaction with the HubSpot CRM API for managing contacts, deals, and associations.
*   **Robust Error Handling and Logging:** A consistent pattern of using `try-catch` blocks and `Log::error` messages is present across the HubSpot service files, ensuring that errors are caught, logged with contextual details, and often allow for continued processing of other items.
*   **Data Preparation:** There's a clear process of preparing data before sending it to HubSpot, involving mapping (via `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`) and removing irrelevant internal properties.
*   **Association-Centric:** The services focus heavily on creating various associations within HubSpot, linking primary and deceased contacts, contacts with deals, and both contacts and deals with locations.
*   **Debugging Iterations:** The presence and subsequent removal of `dd()` statements and temporary hardcoded filters in SQL queries across different files highlight active development and debugging efforts during this period.
*   **Time-Sensitive Development:** The timestamps indicate a concentrated period of development and bug fixing, particularly within the `HubSpotContactService` and `PlotBox\Contact` model.

## 4:03:22 AM
The provided log details changes across several PHP files related to a Paymentus integration hub, primarily focusing on CSV export/import and SFTP operations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Services\Paymentus\CsvExporter.php`**
    *   **Initial setup (2/19/2026, 9:28 AM - 1:49 PM):** The `CsvExporter` class was initially created to generate CSV files for Paymentus. Early changes involved removing a 'status' field from headers and data mapping, and a significant refactoring of all CSV headers from `snake_case` (e.g., `account_number`) to `PascalCase` (e.g., `AccountNumber`). Many data mapping fields were commented out or set to empty strings, suggesting a re-evaluation of required fields. Date formats were initially `Y-m-d` and then changed to `Ymd`.
    *   **Header and Data Mapping Refinements (2/19/2026, 2:07 PM - 5:54 PM):**
        *   Authentication token headers were renamed for clarity (e.g., 'Auth1PhoneCell' to 'Authentication token1').
        *   An attempt was made to introduce phone number formatting using a `formatPhoneNumbers` method, but this was reverted quickly.
        *   Date formatting for `DueDate` and `MaxPostingDate` was frequently adjusted (commented out, restored to `Ymd`, changed to `mdY`). Null coalescing operators (`?? ''`) were added for robustness in date fields.
        *   The 'PaymentType' field was explicitly set to 'VCCC'.
        *   Several `exit;` statements were temporarily added and removed within the `writeChunk` method, indicating active debugging.
        *   Logging within `writeChunk` was significantly enhanced to include detailed raw data (contract, facility, contact information) for each mapped record, also changing object serialization from `toArray()` to `toJson(JSON_PRETTY_PRINT)` for related entities.
    *   **Final Header and Mapping Adjustments (2/19/2026, 6:01 PM - 6:40 PM):**
        *   Mobile and Landline headers were renamed to 'Day Phone' and 'Evening Phone', with new 'Day Ext' and 'Evening Ext' headers added (though left empty in the mapping).
        *   The date formats for `DueDate` and `MaxPostingDate` were finalized to `m/d/Y`.
        *   Several commented-out lines were removed for cleaner code.
        *   Headers were further standardized with spaces (e.g., 'Account Number', 'Zip/Postal Code').
        *   The `formatPhoneNumbers` method, which was previously unused after reverts, was removed.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContact.php`**
    *   **Attribute Accessors (2/19/2026, 2:31 PM - 6:31 PM):** Initially, a `mobileNumber()` attribute mutator was added to strip non-digits. This was quickly renamed to `mobile()` and then changed from a mutator (setter) to an accessor (getter). Later, a `landline()` attribute accessor was added, mirroring the logic to format phone numbers by stripping non-digit characters upon retrieval.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusData.php`**
    *   **Debugging and Logging Enhancements (2/19/2026, 2:38 PM - 3:02 PM):** This action, responsible for orchestrating the CSV export, saw the removal and re-addition of `dd()` and `exit;` debugging statements. A notable change was the introduction of a mechanism to collect all records into an `$allRecords` collection and log their detailed structure as JSON after the export process.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContract.php`**
    *   **Scope and Attributes (2/19/2026, 6:14 PM):** A `stateAbbreviation()` attribute accessor was introduced to convert county names to two-letter state abbreviations. A `system()` accessor returning 'plotbox' was added. The `scopeForAccountExport` query was updated to include a `limit(5)` and `orderByRaw('CONTRACT_NUMBER ASC')`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\UploadToSftp.php`**
    *   **SFTP Target Disk Change (2/19/2026, 6:16 PM - 2/20/2026, 4:51 PM):** The `UploadToSftp` action, which handles moving files to an SFTP server, was modified to change the target disk from a generic `'sftp'` to a specific `'paymentus_sftp'`. This file also shows repeated addition/removal of a `dd($fileContents);` debug statement.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\Documents\Paymentus-dev\PlotBox\Client_Contracts_PBX_20260210_201229.txt\pbx_sftp.txt`**
    *   **SFTP Configuration (2/20/2026, 2:10 PM - 2:15 PM):** This text file provides SFTP connection details for PlotBox, including host, user, and directory. A password `7T7DEHZ8uxpe-r3Vnjcn` was explicitly added to the log, which is a security concern as it's sensitive information.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\Documents\Paymentus-dev\paymentus_sftp.txt`**
    *   **SFTP Connection Details (2/20/2026, 2:11 PM):** This text file details SFTP connection information for Paymentus (UAT and Production environments), including host, port, username, and SSH key directories.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\DataTransferObjects\Paymentus\ContractRecord.php`**
    *   **DTO Definition (2/20/2026, 2:34 PM - 2:36 PM):** This file consistently defines a `readonly class ContractRecord` which serves as a Data Transfer Object, encapsulating various contract-related fields such as account number, amounts, dates, and contact details. Multiple identical saves suggest initial creation and subsequent saving without content changes.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\ParseContractFile.php`**
    *   **CSV Parsing Logic (2/20/2026, 2:43 PM - 3:16 PM):** This action provides functionality to parse CIF CSV files into `ContractRecord` DTOs. It handles file opening, header extraction, row-by-row parsing, error logging for malformed rows, and includes a `parseDate` helper method expecting `mdY` format. Multiple identical saves suggest initial creation and subsequent saving without content changes.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\ParsePaymentFile.php`**
    *   **Payment File Parsing (2/20/2026, 3:17 PM):** This action defines a similar parsing logic to `ParseContractFile`, but specifically for payment files, mapping rows to `PaymentRecord` DTOs.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\FetchSftpPaymentFile.php`**
    *   **SFTP File Fetching (2/20/2026, 3:41 PM - 3:42 PM):** This action is responsible for connecting to an SFTP server, scanning for payment files matching a pattern, selecting the latest file, and downloading it to a local temporary path. It includes detailed logging for each step.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\filesystems.php`**
    *   **SFTP Disk Configurations (2/20/2026, 4:50 PM - 4:51 PM):** New SFTP disk configurations were added for `plotbox_sftp` and `paymentus_sftp`, providing specific connection details like host, username, password, port, and root directory.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Development and Debugging:** The `CsvExporter.php` and `ExportPaymentusData.php` files show a highly iterative development process, characterized by frequent small adjustments to headers and data mapping, and the repeated addition/removal of `dd()` and `exit;` statements, indicating intensive debugging.
*   **CSV Header and Data Mapping Evolution:** There's a clear evolution in the CSV output format, from initial `snake_case` headers to `PascalCase` and then finally to more human-readable, spaced headers, along with continuous refinement of date formats and data population logic.
*   **SFTP Integration Focus:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around SFTP integration, including the definition of actions for uploading/downloading files and configuring multiple SFTP disks in `filesystems.php` for different external systems (Paymentus, PlotBox).
*   **Structured Data Handling:** The introduction of `ContractRecord` and `PaymentRecord` DTOs and corresponding `ParseContractFile`/`ParsePaymentFile` actions indicates a move towards more structured and type-safe handling of data for inbound and outbound file processing.
*   **Logging:** There's a consistent pattern of adding detailed logging (especially `Log::debug` and `Log::info`) to track the processing of records and file operations, which is crucial for monitoring integration flows.
*   **Sensitive Information Handling (Security Concern):** The manual logging of SFTP passwords in plain text files like `pbx_sftp.txt` is a recurring security vulnerability.

## 5:03:06 AM
The log details recent development work on integrating PlotBox data with HubSpot CRM, focusing on contact and deal synchronization.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotContactService.php`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 2/18/2026, 2:09:54 PM**: Initial implementation or major update of the `HubSpotContactService` class. It includes methods to `createContact`, `updateContact`, and `associatePrimaryAndDeceasedContacts` in HubSpot. Key functionalities include:
        *   Sanitizing contact properties by unsetting fields like `loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, and `service_type_code` before sending them to HubSpot.
        *   Robust error handling with detailed logging for both `ContactsApiException` and general `Exception` at each step.
        *   Setting up user-defined associations for "next of kin" contacts.
    *   **Timestamp: 2/18/2026, 2:23:45 PM & 2:26:13 PM**: Introduction of `dd($property);` debugging statements within the `updateContact` method's property removal loop. These were likely used to inspect the `$property` variable during execution.
    *   **Timestamp: 2/18/2026, 2:27:29 PM**: Significant fix in the `updateContact` method's property removal loop. The loop was refactored from `foreach ($contactProperties as $property)` to `foreach ($contactProperties as $key => $property)` to correctly unset properties by their `$key` instead of attempting to use their value as a key, and the debugging `dd()` calls were removed.
    *   **Timestamp: 2/18/2026, 2:28:48 PM & 2:30:15 PM**: Minor changes, primarily completing the closing `catch` blocks and adding a `Log::info` message to the `associatePrimaryAndDeceasedContacts` method, indicating completion of the association process. No functional code changes from the previous version.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 2/18/2026, 2:13:00 PM**: Introduction or update of the `Contact` Eloquent model. This model connects to a Snowflake database and defines relationships (`hasMany` `ContractOwner`, `belongsToMany` `Contract`). The most notable part is the `getDataWithDateRange` static method, which executes a complex SQL query using multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to extract detailed contact and contract information, including item counts by category (e.g., caskets, cremation products, ground, markers, mausoleum), deal owner, and facility data, filtered by a date range. It also includes a conditional filter for `DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS = 'Approved'` in a production environment.
    *   **Timestamp: 2/18/2026, 2:29:45 PM**: No changes compared to the previous version.
    *   **Timestamp: 2/19/2026, 9:09:56 AM**: The complex SQL query in `getDataWithDateRange` was temporarily modified to hardcode a specific contract number (`DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '278-1004010610'`), commenting out the original date range filter. This was likely for focused testing.
    *   **Timestamp: 2/19/2026, 9:24:34 AM**: The hardcoded contract number filter was removed, and the original date range filter in the `getDataWithDateRange` method was restored, reverting the query to its general functionality.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 2/19/2026, 9:10:28 AM**: Introduction of a new `PlotBoxHubSpotService` class, which orchestrates the entire data synchronization process from PlotBox to HubSpot.
        *   It initializes `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`, and a `HubSpotRepository`.
        *   The `syncPlotBoxData` method retrieves data, maps it for CRM, and organizes it into batches for primary contacts, deceased contacts, deals, and location associations. It contains a `dd($primaryContactBatch);` debugging statement.
        *   The `processContacts` private method handles the sequential execution of contact creation/updates, deceased contact creation/updates, contact associations, deal creation/updates, and finally, contact-to-location and deal-to-location associations.
        *   It employs `sleep(10)` and `sleep(5)` calls, potentially to manage HubSpot API rate limits or allow for eventual consistency.
        *   Each major processing step within `processContacts` is wrapped in its own `try-catch` block, emphasizing resilience to ensure that a failure in one area (e.g., deceased contacts) does not halt the entire synchronization.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **2/18/2026, 2:09:54 PM**: Initial or major setup of HubSpot contact creation/update logic.
*   **2/18/2026, 2:13:00 PM**: Introduction of comprehensive PlotBox data extraction SQL.
*   **2/18/2026, 2:27:29 PM**: Critical bug fix in HubSpot contact update logic for property handling.
*   **2/19/2026, 9:09:56 AM**: Temporary implementation of a hardcoded test filter in the PlotBox data query.
*   **2/19/2026, 9:10:28 AM**: Introduction of the main PlotBox-to-HubSpot synchronization service.
*   **2/19/2026, 9:24:34 AM**: Reversion of the PlotBox data query to its general, date-range based filtering.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Debugging Statements (`dd()`):** Repeated use of `dd()` in both `HubSpotContactService.php` and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` indicates active debugging sessions during development, which were then removed or modified.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** A consistent pattern of detailed `Log::error` messages accompanied by `try-catch` blocks is present across all HubSpot service methods, ensuring robust failure reporting and continuation of processing where possible.
*   **Property Sanitation:** The `HubSpotContactService` consistently removes specific internal properties (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `service_type_code`) before sending data to HubSpot, indicating a clean data transfer strategy.
*   **Resilience in Synchronization:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService` demonstrates a focus on making the sync process resilient, with individual `try-catch` blocks for different stages (contacts, deals, associations) and deliberate `sleep()` calls, suggesting a consideration for external API behavior and fault tolerance.
*   **Iterative Development and Testing:** The rapid changes to `HubSpotContactService.php` and the temporary hardcoding in `PlotBox\Contact.php` followed by its reversion illustrate an iterative development and testing cycle.
