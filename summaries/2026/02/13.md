The changes log primarily details the development and refinement of a Paymentus integration module within a Laravel application (`es_integration_hub`). The core functionality revolves around exporting contract and customer data from a Snowflake data warehouse into a specific CSV format (CIF file) and then uploading these files to an SFTP server.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\Documents\Client_Contracts_PBX_20260210_201229.txt` (Timestamp: 2/12/2026, 1:22:02 PM)**: This file contains sample client contract data, including details like contract number, names, addresses, phone numbers, contract dates, amounts, and payment information. It represents the type of raw data that the integration system processes.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContract.php` (Significant changes between 2/12/2026, 4:12:09 PM and 8:58:42 PM)**:
    *   Initially, the `scopeForAccountExport` method used a mix of Eloquent and raw SQL with `DB::raw` for complex calculations and subqueries, including logic to determine `amount_due`, `amount_past_due`, `days_past_due`, and `state_province`.
    *   A major refactoring occurred around **8:19:07 PM**, where the `scopeForAccountExport` method was rewritten to leverage Eloquent relationships (`with()`) for better code organization and readability. Complex data calculations were moved into protected `Attribute` mutators (computed properties) for `amountDue`, `amountPastDue`, `daysPastDue`, `maxPostingDate`, and `stateAbbreviation`. This shift significantly improved the model's structure.
    *   Related model relationships were refined (e.g., `primaryContractOwner` changed to `HasOne`, `currentScheduleDetails` added as `HasManyThrough`).
    *   Around **8:29:39 PM**, raw SQL conditions (`whereRaw`) were introduced into `scopeForAccountExport`, and a `system` computed attribute was added. The primary key and `paid_and_full_date` casting were also updated to use uppercase column names.
    *   Later changes, notably at **8:58:42 PM**, involved removing the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` schema prefix from the `$table` property, indicating a configuration change to handle the schema at the database connection level. A `->limit(1)` clause was added to the `scopeForAccountExport` method for testing purposes, which was eventually adjusted to `->limit(5)` then back to `limit(1)`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Services\Paymentus\CsvExporter.php` (Significant changes between 2/12/2026, 4:50:38 PM and 8:40:57 PM)**:
    *   The service was initially set up to create CSV files, defining headers (`getHeaders`) and mapping record objects to rows (`mapRecordToRow`).
    *   Early changes (around **4:51:57 PM**) involved switching the CSV writer instantiation method from `Writer::createF` to `Writer::from` and later `Writer::createFromPath` and back again, alongside modifying temporary file naming to include `_CIF.csv` (around **4:54:51 PM**).
    *   The `finalize` method was updated at **5:52:07 PM** to hardcode the `paymentus` storage disk, removing a parameter.
    *   A significant update at **8:22:58 PM** refactored `mapRecordToRow` to directly access the computed attributes and relationships from the `DimContract` model, aligning it with the model's new structure. It also explicitly included the `STATUS` field in the output.
    *   The `writeChunk` method signature was updated at **8:37:25 PM** to accept `LazyCollection|Collection`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\UploadToSftp.php` (Initial commit at 2/12/2026, 4:57:58 PM)**: This action defines the logic for uploading generated files to an SFTP server, including logging and error handling. The `localDisk` parameter defaults to 'paymentus'. No major functional changes occurred after its initial implementation.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Console\Commands\Integrations\PaymentusExportCommand.php` (Significant changes between 2/12/2026, 5:02:15 PM and 8:48:56 PM)**:
    *   This command is responsible for initiating the Paymentus export process by dispatching `ExportPaymentusDataJob` for different data sources (currently only `DimContract` for 'snowflake').
    *   It saw changes in how job parameters were passed, notably the removal of the `disk` parameter (around **5:47:00 PM**) and switching `batchSize` to use `config()` for centralized settings (around **6:36:54 PM**).
    *   The database `connection` for `DimContract` was changed from 'plotbox' to 'snowflake' (around **7:38:26 PM**).
    *   Multiple temporary debugging `dd()` statements were added and removed (e.g., at **7:51:49 PM**).
    *   There was a brief period of incorrect refactoring where the command attempted to call `ExportPaymentusData::dispatch` or `ExportPaymentusData->execute` directly, which was quickly corrected back to dispatching `ExportPaymentusDataJob` (ending at **8:48:56 PM**).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Jobs\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusDataJob.php` (Significant changes between 2/12/2026, 5:03:41 PM and 6:49:17 PM)**:
    *   This job wraps the export logic, making it queueable. It coordinates the execution of `ExportPaymentusData` (for CSV generation) and `UploadToSftp`.
    *   Parameter names were refined (e.g., `$connection` to `$dbConnection` at **5:03:54 PM**).
    *   At **5:48:33 PM**, the `disk` parameter was removed from the job's constructor, and a new `$uploadToSftp` boolean flag was added to control the SFTP upload conditionally.
    *   The job's queue connection was explicitly set in the constructor at **6:49:17 PM** using `config('queue.default')`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusData.php` (Initial commit at 2/12/2026, 5:49:19 PM, then updated at 8:03:51 PM)**: This action now focuses purely on the data extraction and CSV writing, delegating the SFTP upload. It removed the `$disk` parameter from its `execute` method, aligning with the `CsvExporter`'s hardcoded disk. Debugging `dd()` statements were also added and removed here.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimFacility.php`, `DimContractOwner.php`, `DimContact.php`, `DimPayment.php`, `DimPaymentSchedule.php` (Multiple timestamps around 2/12/2026, 8:56 PM - 8:57 PM)**: These related models consistently underwent a change to remove the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` schema prefix from their `$table` property, similar to `DimContract`, signifying a centralized schema configuration. `DimContact` also casts `NON_MAILABLE_ADDRESS` to a boolean.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\queue.php` (Multiple changes between 2/12/2026, 6:56:04 PM and 7:55:46 PM)**: This configuration file saw several iterative changes to the `default` queue connection and the `database` queue driver settings, including toggling between `sync`, `database`, and `laravel` as the default, and commenting/uncommenting the `connection` key within the `database` driver. The final state at **7:55:46 PM** explicitly sets the `connection` for the `database` queue driver to 'laravel'.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\database.php` (Multiple timestamps around 2/12/2026, 7:35:28 PM and 9:00:29 PM)**: This file defines the various database connections, including 'snowflake'. There were minor saves/formatting changes, but no significant functional modifications to this file within the provided log.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Paymentus Integration Development**: The primary theme is the active development of a Paymentus data export integration, focusing on extracting contract details from a Snowflake data warehouse, transforming them into a CSV format, and transferring them via SFTP.
*   **Refactoring for Readability and Maintainability**: There's a clear pattern of refactoring, especially in the `DimContract` model, moving from raw SQL to more idiomatic Laravel Eloquent features (relationships, computed attributes). This indicates an emphasis on cleaner, more maintainable code.
*   **Configuration Management**: Changes in `config/queue.php` and `DimContract` (removing schema prefixes) point to an ongoing effort to centralize and streamline configuration, reducing hardcoded values in code.
*   **Iterative Development & Debugging**: The frequent small changes, including adding and removing `dd()` statements, and the multiple revisions to how jobs are dispatched or parameters are handled, suggest an iterative development process with active debugging.
*   **Standardized Export Format**: The consistent use of specific headers in `CsvExporter` (e.g., `account_number`, `amount_due`, `first_name`, `state_province`) indicates a predefined target format for the Paymentus CIF file.
*   **Dependency Injection**: The use of constructor injection in `ExportPaymentusData` and `ExportPaymentusDataJob` for services like `CsvExporter` and `UploadToSftp` is a recurring pattern, adhering to good design principles.

## 12:02:27 PM
The code changes primarily revolve around implementing a Paymentus data export feature within a Laravel application, `es_integration_hub`. This involves extracting contract data, formatting it into a CSV file, and uploading it via SFTP.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\Documents\Client_Contracts_PBX_20260210_201229.txt` (2/12/2026, 1:22:02 PM):** This text file serves as an example or source of raw contract data. It contains detailed fields such as system location, contract number, names, addresses, phone numbers, contract dates, amounts, payment schedules, and status information for multiple clients (e.g., Madron V Wilson, William I Wilson), predominantly from "PlotBox 201" and located in Florence, AL. It frequently shows "Conversion Conversion" for contract status.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContract.php` (Multiple updates from 2/12/2026, 4:12:09 PM to 9:03:44 PM):**
    *   **Initial Setup:** The Eloquent model `DimContract` was established, connecting to a Snowflake database. It defined basic relationships to other dimensions (Facility, Payment Schedule, Payment, Contract Owner) and included a complex `scopeForAccountExport` method initially using raw SQL subqueries to fetch and derive export data. An older, more complex SQL query was commented out, indicating prior attempts.
    *   **Refinement and Architectural Shift:** The `scopeForAccountExport` method underwent significant changes. Initially, it involved generating raw SQL CTEs for due amounts and state abbreviations. However, a major architectural shift occurred (around **8:19:07 PM**), where the complex SQL logic was largely removed from the query scope and replaced with Laravel's computed attributes (accessors) such as `amountDue`, `amountPastDue`, `daysPastDue`, `maxPostingDate`, `stateAbbreviation`, and `system`. This change greatly simplified the SQL query to only select base columns, relying on PHP for data transformation and derivation, enabled by eager loading necessary relationships (`facility`, `primaryContractOwner.contact`, `payments`). Relationship definitions were also updated, for instance, `primaryContractOwner` changed from `BelongsTo` to `HasOne`, and new models like `DimContact` and `DimPayment` were implicitly relied upon. `HasManyThrough` for `currentScheduleDetails` was introduced but later removed, simplifying the calculation of `amountDue` to depend only on `NEXT_EXPECTED_PAYMENT_DATE`. Primary and foreign key names were consistently capitalized (e.g., `CONTRACT_ID`, `FACILITY_ID`), and schema prefixes were removed from table names (e.g., `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT` became `DIM_CONTRACT`), suggesting a change in Snowflake configuration or a more streamlined approach. Debugging `limit` clauses (`->limit(1)`, then `->limit(5)`) were temporarily added and removed.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Services\Paymentus\CsvExporter.php` (Multiple updates from 2/12/2026, 4:50:38 PM to 2/13/2026, 10:13:58 AM):**
    *   **Core Functionality:** This service handles the creation of the Paymentus CIF file. It defines methods to `initialize` the CSV writer, `writeChunk` of records, and `finalize` by saving the file to storage and cleaning up the temporary file.
    *   **Evolution of Mapping:** The `getHeaders()` method consistently defines 36 fields for the export. The `mapRecordToRow` method was initially a direct mapping of object properties. Following the `DimContract` model's refactoring, this method was significantly updated (around **8:22:58 PM**) to access the newly implemented computed attributes and eager-loaded relationships (e.g., `$record->amount_due`, `$record->state_abbreviation`, `$record->primaryContractOwner?->contact?->MOBILE`). Minor adjustments included changing `League\Csv\Writer` instantiation methods and adding `status` to headers. `LazyCollection` was added to `writeChunk`'s type hint (around **8:39:32 PM**).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\UploadToSftp.php` (2/12/2026, 4:57:58 PM):** This action class was introduced to manage the SFTP upload of the generated CSV file. It logs the upload process, retrieves the file from a local disk (defaulting to 'paymentus'), uploads it to an 'sftp' disk, and then deletes the local copy.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Console\Commands\Integrations\PaymentusExportCommand.php` (Multiple updates from 2/12/2026, 5:02:15 PM to 8:48:56 PM):**
    *   **Command Definition:** This Laravel console command (`hub:paymentus-export-file`) is responsible for initiating the export. It dispatches `ExportPaymentusDataJob` for configured data sources (initially only 'plotbox' using `DimContract`).
    *   **Job Dispatch Refinements:** Parameters passed to the dispatched job evolved, with `disk` becoming hardcoded within the actions/services, and `batchSize` moving to be configurable via a config file instead of a command option. Various debugging attempts (e.g., `dd($export);`) were temporarily added and removed. Crucially, incorrect attempts to call `ExportPaymentusData` directly (an action) were made (around **8:47:13 PM**) and quickly corrected back to dispatching `ExportPaymentusDataJob`. The `connection` and `filenamePrefix` for `DimContract` were temporarily altered for testing, settling on `'snowflake'` for the connection and `'plotbox'` for the prefix.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Jobs\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusDataJob.php` (Multiple updates from 2/12/2026, 5:03:41 PM to 6:49:17 PM):** This Laravel queue job orchestrates the export process by calling the `ExportPaymentusData` action and the `UploadToSftp` action. It manages logging, retries, and timeouts. Parameters were adjusted over time (e.g., `connection` renamed to `dbConnection`, `disk` removed and `uploadToSftp` added). The job was configured to explicitly use the default queue connection from the application's configuration (around **6:49:17 PM**).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusData.php` (Multiple updates from 2/12/2026, 5:49:19 PM to 8:03:51 PM):** This action class contains the logic to execute the data export. It initializes the `CsvExporter`, queries data using the `DimContract` model's `forAccountExport` scope, processes data in chunks, and finalizes the CSV. Temporary `dd()` statements were used for debugging.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\queue.php` (Multiple updates from 2/12/2026, 6:56:04 PM to 7:55:46 PM):** This configuration file for Laravel's queue system saw frequent modifications. The `default` queue connection was repeatedly switched between `sync`, `database`, and `laravel`, indicating active development and testing of queue drivers. The `database` connection's specific settings (connection, table, queue, retry_after) were also toggled between environment variables and hardcoded values, reflecting attempts to stabilize or test queue behavior.

*   **New Models (`DimFacility.php`, `DimContact.php`, `DimPayment.php`) (Introduced around 2/12/2026, 8:56:16 PM):** These new Eloquent models were created to represent other dimension tables in the Snowflake data warehouse. They define their respective connections, table names (without schema prefixes), primary keys, and relationships, supporting the `DimContract` model's data fetching requirements.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Paymentus Integration Focus:** The consistent naming (`Paymentus`, `CIF.csv`) and the structure of the CSV export (headers) highlight the primary goal of integrating with the Paymentus system for account/payment data.
*   **Snowflake Data Source:** The repeated use of `protected $connection = 'snowflake';` across the new models and the adjustments in SQL queries point to Snowflake as the primary data warehouse being integrated.
*   **Iterative Development & Debugging:** The numerous small changes, toggling of configurations, and temporary insertion/removal of `dd()` debugging statements demonstrate an iterative development workflow, common when building complex integrations.
*   **Refactoring Towards Eloquent-centric Logic:** A significant pattern is the shift in `DimContract` from generating complex raw SQL queries (including CTE-like structures) to leveraging Laravel's Eloquent relationships and computed attributes (accessors) for data derivation and formatting. This generally leads to more maintainable and readable code within the Laravel ecosystem.
*   **Standardized CSV Output:** The `CsvExporter` consistently produces a file with the same 36 headers, indicating a strict requirement for the output format.
*   **Modular Architecture:** The use of separate `Command`, `Job`, `Action`, `Service`, and `Model` classes shows a clear adherence to a modular, object-oriented architecture in Laravel, promoting separation of concerns.
*   **Database Naming Conventions:** The transition of primary/foreign key names and table names to uppercase in models (e.g., `CONTRACT_ID`, `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`) suggests an adaptation to a specific database naming convention, likely case-sensitive requirements of Snowflake.

## 3:01:54 PM
The changes primarily revolve around implementing and refining a Paymentus data export feature within a Laravel application, integrating with a Snowflake data warehouse. The export generates CIF (Customer Information File) CSV files containing contract, owner, and payment details.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\Documents\Client_Contracts_PBX_20260210_201229.txt` (Timestamp: 2/12/2026, 1:22:02 PM)**: This file contains sample client contract data in a delimited format, with fields such as System, Contract Number, Personal Information (Name, Address, Phone), Contract Details (Amount, Balance, Dates, Terms), and Payment History. The data mostly pertains to "Pre-need" contracts with a "Conversion" status, many originating in 1957.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContract.php` (Timestamps: 2/12/2026, 4:12:09 PM - 8:58:42 PM)**: This Eloquent model, connected to Snowflake, underwent significant iterative development for its `scopeForAccountExport` method.
    *   Initially, it used a complex raw SQL query with CTEs (`dueSubquery`, `stateSubquery`) to select and calculate various contract-related fields, including amount due, past due, days past due, and state abbreviations.
    *   Later, this was completely refactored to leverage Eloquent relationships (`with`) for fetching related data (facility, primary contract owner, payments, current schedule details) and introduced computed attributes (`amountDue`, `amountPastDue`, `daysPastDue`, `maxPostingDate`, `stateAbbreviation`, `system`) to derive the required values programmatically.
    *   The primary key was updated to `CONTRACT_ID` (uppercase).
    *   The table name was simplified by removing the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` schema prefix, indicating that the Snowflake connection configuration now handles this.
    *   Small adjustments include casting `daysPastDue` to `int` and adding a `limit(1)` for debugging, which was later removed or reverted to limit(5).
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Services\Paymentus\CsvExporter.php` (Timestamps: 2/12/2026, 4:50:38 PM - 2/13/2026, 10:13:58 AM)**: This service manages the creation and writing of CSV files.
    *   Initial changes involved correcting the `League\Csv\Writer` instantiation from `createF()` to `from()` and later to `createFromPath()`.
    *   The temporary filename generation was updated to append `_CIF.csv`.
    *   The `finalize()` method was modified to hardcode `Storage::disk('paymentus')`, removing the `$disk` parameter.
    *   A major update in `mapRecordToRow` (around 8:22 PM) involved adapting it to use the computed attributes and eager-loaded relationships from the `DimContract` model, directly mapping them to the predefined CSV headers. The 'status' column was also added to the headers.
    *   The `writeChunk` method's type hint for `$records` was updated to accept `LazyCollection` in addition to `Collection`.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\UploadToSftp.php` (Timestamps: 2/12/2026, 4:57:58 PM - 5:52:45 PM)**: This action handles the SFTP upload of the generated CSV file. The implementation remained consistent, including logging and optional local file deletion.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Console\Commands\Integrations\PaymentusExportCommand.php` (Timestamps: 2/12/2026, 5:02:15 PM - 8:48:56 PM)**: This console command triggers the Paymentus export.
    *   It dispatches `ExportPaymentusDataJob` for different systems (currently only `DimContract` for 'plotbox' is active).
    *   The `disk` parameter for job dispatch was removed to align with `CsvExporter` changes.
    *   The `batchSize` parameter was updated to be configurable from `config('integrations.paymentus.batch_size', 1000)`.
    *   There were several minor changes to the `connection` and `filenamePrefix` values for the `DimContract` model (e.g., 'plotbox' to 'snowflake' and back).
    *   Debugging lines (`dd($export);`) were temporarily added and then removed.
    *   Briefly, the command incorrectly attempted to dispatch the `ExportPaymentusData` action directly instead of the `ExportPaymentusDataJob`, which was subsequently corrected.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Jobs\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusDataJob.php` (Timestamps: 2/12/2026, 5:03:41 PM - 6:49:17 PM)**: This queueable job orchestrates the export and upload.
    *   Renamed the constructor parameter `connection` to `dbConnection` for clarity.
    *   The `disk` parameter was removed from the constructor and method calls, as the handling of the storage disk was centralized in `CsvExporter`.
    *   An `$uploadToSftp` boolean was added to the constructor to allow conditional SFTP uploads.
    *   Explicitly sets the queue connection for the job using `$this->onConnection(config('queue.default'));`.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusData.php` (Timestamps: 2/12/2026, 5:49:19 PM - 8:03:51 PM)**: This action performs the actual data export logic.
    *   It now only takes `modelClass`, `connection`, `filenamePrefix`, and `batchSize` as parameters, as `disk` is handled by `CsvExporter`.
    *   Debugging lines (`dd($c);`) were temporarily added and removed.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimFacility.php`, `DimContractOwner.php`, `DimContact.php`, `DimPayment.php`, `DimPaymentSchedule.php` (Timestamps: 2/12/2026, 8:22:02 PM - 8:57:56 PM)**: These related models were updated to remove the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` schema prefix from their `$table` properties, similar to `DimContract.php`, centralizing schema handling at the connection level. Primary keys in `DimContractOwner` were also made consistent (uppercase `CONTRACT_ID`).
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\queue.php` (Timestamps: 2/12/2026, 6:56:04 PM - 7:55:46 PM)**: This configuration file for Laravel queues saw frequent modifications, primarily toggling the `default` queue connection between `sync`, `database`, and `laravel`, and adjusting how `database` queue connection details are sourced (e.g., `DB_QUEUE_CONNECTION` vs. hardcoded 'laravel'). This indicates active testing and configuration changes for the queue system.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\database.php` (Timestamps: 2/12/2026, 7:35:28 PM - 9:00:29 PM)**: Minor changes, ensuring the `snowflake` connection is correctly referenced and configured, consistent with the model changes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Paymentus Integration Workflow:** A consistent pattern is the separation of concerns: a console command to initiate (`PaymentusExportCommand`), a job to queue the task (`ExportPaymentusDataJob`), an action to perform the core export logic (`ExportPaymentusData`), an exporter service to handle CSV specifics (`CsvExporter`), and an action for SFTP upload (`UploadToSftp`).
*   **Snowflake as Data Source:** The models and queries consistently target a Snowflake data warehouse for fetching contract data.
*   **CSV Format Consistency:** The target CSV output format (headers like `account_number`, `amount_due`, `first_name`, `state_province`, etc.) remains constant across `CsvExporter`'s `getHeaders()` and the fields selected in `DimContract`'s `scopeForAccountExport`.
*   **Iterative Refinement of `DimContract`:** The `DimContract` model experienced significant changes in its data retrieval strategy, reflecting an ongoing process to optimize data fetching, possibly for performance, maintainability, or to resolve specific database interaction issues (e.g., complex raw SQL vs. Eloquent relationships).
*   **Queue Configuration Adjustments:** Frequent changes in `config/queue.php` and `ExportPaymentusDataJob` indicate active experimentation or fine-tuning of the application's queuing mechanism for these export jobs.
*   **Debugging Activity:** The presence and removal of `dd()` statements in both commands and actions highlight a development phase involving active debugging.
