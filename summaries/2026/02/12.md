# Activity Summary for 2/12/2026

## 9:07:40 AM
The code changes primarily involve two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` which defines data retrieval logic for PlotBox contacts, and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Hmis\HmisHubSpotService.php` which handle data synchronization with HubSpot for PlotBox and HMIS data, respectively. Additionally, `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\HmisDataToCrmMapper.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\Hmis\Sale.php` received updates related to HMIS data processing.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**:
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM**: The initial version of the `getDataWithDateRange` SQL query was present, filtering contracts by `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within a date range. It also included a `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` calculation in the `contract_tax_totals`.
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 1:37:28 PM**: The date range filtering in the `base_contracts` CTE was commented out and replaced with a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` filter.
    *   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM**: The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE itself was commented out, and its sum was removed from the `contract_tax_totals` calculation.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM**: The tax calculation logic within `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs was modified to use `cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY` and `df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY`, respectively, instead of `f.TAX_AMOUNT`.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM**: A minor casing change from `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` occurred in `contract_fee_tax`.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM**: `CAST(... AS INT)` was explicitly added to the subqueries for `CONTRACT_ID` in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax`.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM**: The hardcoded contract number filter was changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM - 4:26:14 PM**: The `CAST(... AS INT)` was removed from the `CONTRACT_ID` subqueries, correcting a potential syntax issue.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM - 4:27:46 PM**: Further refinements to the `contract_tax_totals` CTE involved removing commented lines related to `cancelled_fee_tax_total` and simplifying the total tax calculation to only include `contract_fee_tax_total` and `deed_fee_tax_total`.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM**: The hardcoded contract number filter was commented out, restoring the original date range filter for `base_contracts`.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:32:48 PM**: The main `SELECT` statement was completed, resolving truncated `COALESCE` statements for `item_counts` and adding `LEFT JOIN` clauses for `item_counts`, `contract_tax_totals`, `contract_net_prices`, and `DIM_FACILITY`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**:
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM**: Contained a `dd($dealsBatch);` debugging statement in the `syncPlotBoxData` method, which would halt script execution.
    *   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM**: The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was removed, allowing the sync process to proceed.
    *   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM**: The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was re-introduced.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Hmis\HmisHubSpotService.php`**:
    *   **1/30/2026, 3:02:18 PM**: This file manages the synchronization of HMIS data to HubSpot, segmenting data by 'SHIPOUT' status. It included a `dd($primaryContactBatch);` for debugging. The `processContacts` method actively searched for and updated contacts and deals.
    *   **1/30/2026, 3:50:31 PM**: The `try-catch` block for processing primary contacts within `processContacts` was commented out, and a `dd($primaryContactsToCreateOrUpdate);` was added.
    *   **1/30/2026, 3:50:42 PM**: The `dd($primaryContactBatch);` in `syncData` was commented out, but the `dd($primaryContactsToCreateOrUpdate);` in `processContacts` remained.
    *   **2/10/2026, 12:54:07 PM**: The debugging `dd()` statements were removed, and the `try-catch` block for primary contacts in `processContacts` was restored.
    *   **2/10/2026, 12:58:40 PM**: A `dd($dealsBatch);` was added back into the `syncData` method.
    *   **2/10/2026, 1:03:10 PM - 1:03:39 PM**: The processing logic for primary contacts in `processContacts` was repeatedly commented out, and a `dd($deceasedContactsToCreateOrUpdate);` was briefly added and removed, indicating active debugging of contact processing.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\HmisDataToCrmMapper.php`**:
    *   **2/10/2026, 12:54:16 PM**: Defined data mapping methods for HubSpot contacts and deals, where `mapDeal` used `trim($hmisDto->purchasePrice)` for the `amount`.
    *   **2/10/2026, 1:02:05 PM**: A new constant `ZERO_PURCHASE_PRICE` was introduced, and the `mapDeal` method was modified to set the deal's `amount` to this `0.00` constant, overriding the actual purchase price.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\Hmis\Sale.php`**:
    *   **2/10/2026, 12:59:03 PM**: The `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query included a `->limit(1)` clause.
    *   **2/10/2026, 1:31:21 PM**: The `->limit(1)` clause was removed from the query.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

A prominent pattern is the **intermittent addition and removal of `dd()` debugging statements**, particularly in the `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` and `HmisHubSpotService.php` files. This suggests an iterative development and testing process, where code execution was frequently paused to inspect data at various stages of the HubSpot synchronization.

Another recurring element in `PlotBox\Contact.php` is the **experimentation with the SQL `WHERE` clauses** for filtering contracts, toggling between a dynamic date range and a hardcoded contract number, and then reverting to the dynamic date range. Similarly, the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its inclusion in the total tax calculation were repeatedly commented out, then completely removed from the sum, indicating changes in business logic or data availability regarding cancelled contract fees. The SQL query also showed a pattern of minor corrections related to data type casting and field references (`f.TAX_AMOUNT` vs. `cf.TAX_AMOUNT`).

Across the HubSpot service files, there's consistent use of `try-catch` blocks for individual processing steps (e.g., primary contacts, deceased contacts, deals, associations) to ensure resilience and partial processing even if certain steps fail. This highlights a focus on robust error handling in the integration services. Both services also separate contacts into "primary" and "deceased" batches and handle "location associations."

The modifications in `HmisDataToCrmMapper.php` and `Hmis\Sale.php` suggest changes in how HMIS sales data is retrieved and mapped to HubSpot, specifically the decision to hardcode deal amounts to zero and adjustments in the SQL query to fetch sales data.

## 11:05:55 AM
The changes primarily focus on developing a new "Paymentus" integration for exporting data from various sources (PlotBox, HMIS, Carlib) into a Customer Information File (CIF) format. This development occurred across several core components of the application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`config/app.php`**: On 2/3/2026, the application's default timezone was updated from 'UTC' to 'America/New_York'.
*   **`config/database.php`**: This file saw multiple saves on 2/4/2026. While the provided snippets appear functionally identical across these saves, the file itself defines a multi-database environment with connections for `laravel` (MySQL), `sims` (MySQL), `home_office` (MySQL), `contract_margin` (MySQL), `corpstruct` (MySQL), `keyserver` (MySQL), `sqlsrv` (MSSQL), and `carlib` (DB2 via ODBC), indicating support for a diverse data landscape.
*   **`config/filesystems.php`**: On 2/4/2026, a new disk configuration named `paymentus` was added, pointing to a local storage path defined by `PAYMENTUS_OUTGOING_FILE_PATH` in the environment, for storing Paymentus export files. A minor path adjustment for the root directory was made on 2/4/2026.
*   **`config/integrations.php`**: This new configuration file was introduced on 2/4/2026 to centralize Paymentus-specific settings. It includes API details (`base_url`, `api_key`, `timeout`) and an `export_batch_size` which was initially 1000 and then adjusted to 500.
*   **`bootstrap/app.php`**: On 2/5/2026, the application's bootstrapping was updated to register the `PaymentusExportCommand` console command, making it available for execution.
*   **`routes/console.php`**: On 2/5/2026, a commented-out line was added to schedule the `hub:paymentus-export-file` command to run daily at 02:00, indicating a planned automation of the export process.

**Core Paymentus Integration Components:**

*   **Eloquent Models (`app/Models/Paymentus/*.php`)**: A suite of new models were created on 2/4/2026 to represent various entities (`DimContract`, `DimFacility`, `DimPaymentSchedule`, `DimPaymentScheduleDetail`, `DimPayment`, `DimContractOwner`, `DimContact`) related to the Paymentus integration. These models are configured to connect to a `snowflake` database and query tables within the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` schema.
    *   **`DimContract.php`** (most frequently modified model):
        *   Received a complex `scopeForAccountExport` method on 2/4/2026, which defines a joined SQL query to select numerous fields for the Paymentus export, including calculated amounts, contact details, and channel blocks.
        *   This query was iteratively refined on 2/4/2026 to standardize column casing (to uppercase), ensure correct string quoting, and handle alias quoting within `DB::raw` expressions for better database compatibility (likely with Snowflake).
        *   The `casts` array was temporarily updated and then reverted/re-added with `'paid_and_full_date' => 'date'` on 2/6/2026.
*   **Console Command (`app/Console/Commands/Integrations/PaymentusExportCommand.php`)**:
    *   Initiated on 2/4/2026 as `hub:paymentus-export-command` with a generic description, which was later updated to "Export payments data from PlotBox, HMIS and Carlib to Paymentus in a CIF file."
    *   It evolved from directly calling an exporter action to dispatching multiple queueable jobs (`ExportPaymentusDataJob`) for different data sources (PlotBox, HMIS, Carlib) on 2/6/2026. Notably, the HMIS and Carlib exports were commented out, suggesting a phased implementation or testing focus.
    *   The command signature was renamed to `hub:paymentus-export-file` on 2/5/2026.
    *   The command now leverages configuration for disk and batch size (`config('filesystems.paymentus')`, `config('integrations.paymentus.export_batch_size')`).
*   **Action (`app/Actions/Paymentus/ExportPaymentusData.php`)**:
    *   Created on 2/4/2026 to encapsulate the core export logic. It orchestrates the process of querying data, initializing a `CsvExporter`, and writing data in chunks.
    *   Refactored on 2/6/2026 to be more generic, accepting a `modelClass` (string), `connection` (string), and `filenamePrefix` as arguments, allowing it to be reused for different data sources.
    *   Includes logging for tracking export progress. The generated filename now includes a prefix and a `_CIF` suffix.
*   **Service (`app/Services/Paymentus/CsvExporter.php`)**:
    *   Developed on 2/4/2026 to handle the technical aspects of CSV file generation. It defines a standard set of 35 headers for the export, manages a temporary file, writes data chunks, and finalizes the file to the specified storage disk.
    *   A minor change to use `Writer::from` instead of `Writer::createFromPath` occurred on 2/4/2026. On 2/6/2026, it was updated to store the target filename internally and adjusted a type hint in `mapRecordToRow`.
*   **Data Transfer Object (`app/DataTransferObjects/Paymentus/ExportResult.php`)**:
    *   Introduced on 2/4/2026 as a `readonly` DTO to convey the results of an export (filename and record count). The `lineCount` property was renamed to `recordCount` on 2/6/2026.
*   **Job (`app/Jobs/Paymentus/ExportPaymentusDataJob.php`)**:
    *   A new queueable job created on 2/6/2026, allowing the export process to run asynchronously. It's configured with retry attempts (`tries = 3`) and a timeout (`timeout = 3600`). It dispatches the `ExportPaymentusData` action for a specific model, connection, and filename prefix, and includes comprehensive logging for its lifecycle (start, completion, failure).
*   **Action (`app/Actions/Paymentus/UploadToSftp.php`)**:
    *   A new action created on 2/6/2026 responsible for uploading the generated CSV files to an SFTP server. It includes logging for the upload process and deletes the local file upon successful transfer.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **February 3, 2026:**
    *   **5:13 PM**: Application timezone configuration in `app.php` was updated.
*   **February 4, 2026:**
    *   **1:11 PM - 1:19 PM**: Initial setup of console command and the suite of Paymentus-related Eloquent models.
    *   **1:20 PM**: Addition of the complex `scopeForAccountExport` method to `DimContract.php`.
    *   **3:23 PM**: Refinement of the `PaymentusExportCommand` description, indicating concrete development.
    *   **4:47 PM - 5:16 PM**: Rapid development and iteration on the `PaymentusExportCommand` and `ExportPaymentusData` action, including the creation of `CsvExporter` and `ExportResult` DTO.
    *   **5:40 PM - 5:42 PM**: Creation and initial configuration of `config/integrations.php` for Paymentus settings.
*   **February 5, 2026:**
    *   **2:25 PM - 2:34 PM**: Console command registration in `bootstrap/app.php` and an entry for scheduling in `routes/console.php`.
*   **February 6, 2026:**
    *   **1:11 PM - 1:55 PM**: Major architectural shift with the introduction of `ExportPaymentusDataJob` for asynchronous processing, the generalization of `ExportPaymentusData` to handle multiple data sources, and the creation of `UploadToSftp` for file transfer. Model definition for `DimContract` also saw minor adjustments to its cast properties during this period.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Paymentus Integration as a Feature:** The overwhelming majority of changes are centered around implementing the Paymentus data export feature, evident from the naming conventions (Paymentus prefix in file paths, class names, and configuration keys).
*   **Modular and Layered Architecture:** The development progresses from monolithic command logic to a more organized structure using actions (business logic), services (utility/technical logic), models (data access), DTOs (data encapsulation), and jobs (asynchronous execution).
*   **Snowflake Data Warehouse:** The consistent use of the 'snowflake' connection and `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` schema across the Paymentus models indicates a strategic reliance on Snowflake for this data integration.
*   **CSV Export Standard:** A fixed structure for the exported CSV file is defined by a consistent set of 35 headers in `CsvExporter`.
*   **Configuration-Driven:** The application leverages environment variables and dedicated configuration files (`.env`, `config/integrations.php`, `config/filesystems.php`) for flexible deployment and management of integration settings.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** The adoption of queueable jobs for the export process highlights a design choice for scalability and handling potentially long-running data operations in the background.
*   **Iterative Development and Refinement:** Multiple timestamp entries for the same files, especially `DimContract.php` and `PaymentusExportCommand.php`, show an iterative development cycle with continuous improvements, bug fixes (e.g., SQL quoting, model reference in actions), and architectural adjustments.
*   **Logging:** The introduction of `Log::info` and `Log::debug` statements in actions and jobs signifies an emphasis on observability and debugging for the new integration.
