# Activity Summary for 2/10/2026

## 12:08:16 AM
The codebase is primarily focused on developing and refining a Paymentus data export integration, involving multiple database sources and asynchronous processing.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\app.php`**: On 2/3/2026 at 5:13:46 PM, the application's default timezone was updated from 'UTC' to 'America/New_York'.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\database.php`**: Starting 2/4/2026 at 11:18:26 AM, this file received extensive configuration for multiple database connections. New connections were added for `sims`, `home_office`, `contract_margin`, `corpstruct`, `keyserver`, `hmis`, and `carlib`, utilizing MySQL, SQLSRV, and DB2 (via ODBC). Each connection specifies host, port, database, credentials (retrieved from environment variables), charset, collation, and in some cases, specific migration paths. Subsequent entries on the same day show no functional changes.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Console\Commands\Integrations\PaymentusExportCommand.php`**: This command, initially a placeholder (2/4/2026, 1:11:46 PM), evolved significantly. Its description was clarified to "Export payments data from PlotBox, HMIS and Carlib to Paymentus in a CIF file" (2/4/2026, 3:23:58 PM). The `handle` method was progressively implemented to delegate export logic to an `ExportPaymentusData` action, passing configuration values for disk and batch size from Laravel's config system (e.g., `config('filesystems.paymentus')`, `config('integrations.paymentus.export_batch_size')`). The command's signature was changed to `hub:paymentus-export-file` (2/5/2026, 2:33:38 PM). A major refactoring occurred around 2/6/2026, 1:26:17 PM, shifting from direct execution to dispatching multiple `ExportPaymentusDataJob` instances for different data sources (initially Plotbox, HMIS, Carlib, later commented out HMIS and Carlib with a TODO). The command now primarily dispatches jobs and reports their successful dispatch.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContract.php`**: Created on 2/4/2026 at 1:16:04 PM, this Eloquent model maps to `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT` in a Snowflake database. It defines relationships to `DimFacility`, `DimPaymentSchedule`, `DimPayment`, `DimContractOwner`. The most substantial development was the `forAccountExport` query scope (2/4/2026, 1:20:41 PM), a complex SQL query involving multiple joins and calculated fields. This scope underwent several iterations (2/4/2026, 1:36:11 PM - 1:49:19 PM) to refine quoting of identifiers and literals to ensure compatibility with Snowflake's SQL syntax. A `paid_and_full_date` cast was briefly added and then reverted on 2/6/2026.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimFacility.php`**: Created on 2/4/2026 at 1:16:57 PM, mapping to `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_FACILITY`, with a `HasMany` relationship to `DimContract`.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimPaymentSchedule.php`**: Created on 2/4/2026 at 1:17:32 PM, mapping to `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_PAYMENT_SCHEDULE`, defining `BelongsTo` and `HasMany` relationships. A quick follow-up commit (2/4/2026, 1:17:39 PM) added missing `use` statements for relationships.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimPaymentScheduleDetail.php`**: Created on 2/4/2026 at 1:18:16 PM, mapping to `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_PAYMENT_SCHEDULE_DETAIL`, with a `COMPLETED_DATE` cast to date and a `BelongsTo` relationship.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimPayment.php`**: Created on 2/4/2026 at 1:18:48 PM, mapping to `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_PAYMENT`, with a `payment_date` cast to date and a `BelongsTo` relationship.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContractOwner.php`**: Created on 2/4/2026 at 1:19:18 PM, mapping to `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`, with `BelongsTo` relationships to `DimContract` and `DimContact`.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContact.php`**: Created on 2/4/2026 at 1:19:43 PM, mapping to `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT`, with a `NON_MAILABLE_ADDRESS` cast to boolean and a `HasMany` relationship to `DimContractOwner`.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\filesystems.php`**: On 2/4/2026, 3:31:46 PM, a new local filesystem disk named `paymentus` was added, configured to store outgoing files. Subsequent entries show minor or no functional changes.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Services\Paymentus\CsvExporter.php`**: Introduced on 2/4/2026, 4:54:28 PM, this service is responsible for generating Paymentus CSV files. It includes methods for initialization, writing data in chunks, and finalizing the export by moving the temporary file to the specified storage disk. It defines 35 CSV headers and a mapping function for records. Changes included updating the `league/csv` library usage (`Writer::from` instead of `createFromPath`) and refining how the final filename is managed (2/6/2026, 1:31:35 PM).
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusData.php`**: This action, first seen on 2/4/2026, 5:06:09 PM, orchestrates the data export. It evolved from a basic setup to a comprehensive, reusable component. Key changes include implementing the core export logic, dynamically generating filenames with a `_CIF` suffix, correctly querying `DimContract` (after an initial misstep with `DimContact`), and returning an `ExportResult` DTO. Around 2/6/2026, 1:32:43 PM, it was made generic to accept `modelClass`, `connection`, `filenamePrefix`, `disk`, and `batchSize` as parameters, dynamically setting the database connection for the model. DocBlocks were added to improve documentation.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\DataTransferObjects\Paymentus\ExportResult.php`**: Created on 2/4/2026, 5:18:42 PM, as a `readonly` DTO to hold the `filename` and `lineCount` of an export. The `lineCount` property was later renamed to `recordCount` for semantic clarity (2/6/2026, 1:35:16 PM).
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\bootstrap\app.php`**: On 2/5/2026, 2:26:00 PM, the registration of console commands was corrected, listing `PaymentusExportCommand::class` instead of an action.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\routes\console.php`**: A commented-out scheduled task for `hub:paymentus-export-file` was added on 2/5/2026, 2:34:09 PM, indicating future automation plans.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Jobs\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusDataJob.php`**: This queued job was introduced on 2/6/2026, 1:11:54 PM. It handles asynchronous data exports, configured with retries (`tries = 3`) and a timeout (`3600` seconds). The job's constructor and `handle` method were frequently adjusted to pass all necessary parameters (`modelClass`, `connection`, `filenamePrefix`, `disk`, `batchSize`) to the `ExportPaymentusData` action. Logging for start, completion, and failure was added, and crucially, an `UploadToSftp` action was integrated to transfer the exported file to an SFTP server (2/6/2026, 1:47:01 PM).
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\integrations.php`**: A new configuration file (2/4/2026, 5:40:44 PM) was created to centralize integration settings. It was quickly organized under a `paymentus` key (2/4/2026, 5:42:22 PM) and included API details and an `export_batch_size`, which was adjusted from 1000 to 500 (2/4/2026, 5:42:36 PM).
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\UploadToSftp.php`**: This new action (2/6/2026, 1:45:20 PM) provides functionality to securely upload files from a local disk to an SFTP server, including logging and error handling, and an option to delete the local file after a successful transfer.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Paymentus Integration Development**: The overarching theme is the development of a comprehensive integration with Paymentus for data export. This involves a suite of components: console command, action, service, DTO, queue job, and SFTP upload action.
2.  **Modular Architecture**: The use of Laravel's features like Console Commands, Actions, Services, Jobs, and DTOs demonstrates a modular and organized approach to building the integration pipeline.
3.  **Multi-Database Support**: The application is configured to interact with various database systems (MySQL, SQLSRV, DB2, Snowflake), indicating a complex data landscape. The `DimContract` model, specifically its `forAccountExport` scope, highlights attention to database-specific syntax (Snowflake quoting).
4.  **Asynchronous Processing**: The introduction of `ExportPaymentusDataJob` signifies a move towards asynchronous, resilient data processing, suitable for large exports that might otherwise time out or fail.
5.  **Configuration Management**: Extensive use of Laravel's configuration system, drawing values from environment variables (`.env` files, which are not summarized here due to instructions), allows for flexible environment-specific settings.
6.  **Iterative Refinement**: Several files show multiple, closely timed commits, indicating an iterative development process with frequent saves, bug fixes (e.g., SQL quoting, incorrect model querying), and functional enhancements.
7.  **Data Warehouse Interaction**: The consistent use of `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` in table names across Paymentus models suggests interaction with a centralized data warehouse.
8.  **Detailed Logging**: The inclusion of `Log::info`, `Log::debug`, and `Log::error` statements within the job and actions indicates a focus on observability and troubleshooting for the export process.

## 1:07:54 AM
The log details a series of changes primarily focused on a Laravel Eloquent model and two HubSpot integration services, indicating active development and debugging.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM (Initial State):** The file defines a `Contact` model for a PlotBox data warehouse, using a Snowflake connection. It includes a comprehensive SQL query within the `getDataWithDateRange` static method designed to retrieve contract and contact details, calculating various fee and tax totals, and identifying different types of owned items (caskets, cremation products, etc.). The initial query filters contracts by a `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` range or by contact `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME`.
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 1/21/2026, 4:20:28 PM (Debugging Iterations):** Throughout this period, the file shows extensive modifications, primarily for debugging the `getDataWithDateRange` SQL query.
        *   The original date-range filtering in the `base_contracts` CTE was repeatedly commented out and replaced with a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter (initially `'645-110814'`, later simplified to `'110814'`).
        *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` Common Table Expression (CTE) was commented out.
        *   There were several attempts to adjust the tax calculation logic in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, including a typo where `f.TAX_AMOUNT` was briefly changed to `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` (and then corrected).
        *   `CAST(... AS INT)` syntax was introduced and then corrected/removed within `WHERE ... IN (SELECT ...)` clauses to resolve potential SQL syntax issues.
        *   Several log entries during this period (`12:52:00 PM` to `4:20:28 PM`) show the final `SELECT` statement in the SQL query as truncated, indicating incomplete log captures rather than actual code removal.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM - 1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM (Minor Refinements):** Further minor adjustments were made to the SQL query, particularly around the `contract_tax_totals` CTE, which temporarily attempted to re-include `cancelled_fee_tax_total` while the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE itself remained commented out, leading to subsequent correction.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM (Reversion of Debugging Filter):** The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter was commented out, and the original date-range filter for `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` was uncommented, restoring the intended date-based data retrieval functionality.
    *   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM (Completion/Stabilization):** The truncation issue in the final `SELECT` statement was resolved, displaying the full list of `COALESCE` functions for `item_counts` and the complete join clauses. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remained commented out.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM (Initial State):** The service is designed to sync PlotBox data to HubSpot. It includes a `dd($dealsBatch)` call, a common Laravel debugging function that dumps a variable and stops script execution, placed after batching data but before processing it.
    *   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` line was removed, allowing the `processContacts` method to execute.
    *   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM - 1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` line was re-introduced and remained present, suggesting a resumption or continuation of debugging efforts at this point.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Hmis\HmisHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **1/30/2026, 3:02:18 PM (Initial State):** This service also syncs data to HubSpot, specifically for "Hmis" data. It similarly uses `dd($primaryContactBatch)` after initial data batching but before processing, indicating a debugging pause. This service distinguishes between "SHIPOUT" and non-SHIPOUT service types for separate processing.
    *   **1/30/2026, 3:50:31 PM:** No functional changes, `dd($primaryContactBatch)` persists.
    *   **1/30/2026, 3:50:42 PM:** The `dd($primaryContactBatch)` line was commented out, allowing further execution.
    *   **1/30/2026, 4:06:43 PM - 1/30/2026, 4:08:13 PM:** The processing logic for "primary contacts" within the `processContacts` method was commented out, and a new `dd($deceasedContactsToCreateOrUpdate)` line was inserted in the "deceased contacts" processing block. This indicates a shift in debugging focus from primary contacts to deceased contacts.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Debugging-Driven Development:** A prominent pattern across all modified files is the heavy use of debugging techniques:
    *   **`dd()` calls:** Frequently added, removed, or moved to halt execution and inspect data (`$dealsBatch`, `$primaryContactBatch`, `$deceasedContactsToCreateOrUpdate`).
    *   **Commenting/Uncommenting Code:** Large blocks of SQL (like date filters or entire CTEs) or PHP logic (like primary contact processing) were temporarily commented out or restored, indicating iterative testing and isolation of issues.
*   **SQL Query Refinement:** The `Contact.php` model's `getDataWithDateRange` SQL query underwent continuous refinement, including fixing syntax for subqueries (e.g., `IN (SELECT ...)`), correcting aggregate function parameters, and managing commented-out sections for tax calculations.
*   **HubSpot Integration Services Structure:** Both `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` follow a similar architecture for HubSpot synchronization, involving data fetching, mapping, batching of primary and deceased contacts and deals, and then processing these batches with resilience (using `try-catch` blocks for individual steps) and logging. They both use `sleep()` calls, likely for managing HubSpot API rate limits or ensuring asynchronous operations complete.
*   **Data Source Consistency:** `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` tables in Snowflake are consistently targeted by the `Contact` model for data retrieval.
*   **Unified Logging Strategy:** Both HubSpot services consistently utilize `Log::error` for exceptions and `Log::info` for tracking successful operations and significant events, demonstrating a standardized approach to application monitoring.

## 2:07:55 AM
The code changes primarily involve two areas: an Eloquent model for `PlotBox\Contact.php` that includes a complex SQL query for data retrieval, and two HubSpot integration services, `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` and `HmisHubSpotService.php`.

### File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`

This file, representing a Laravel Eloquent model, contains a static method `getDataWithDateRange` that executes a large Snowflake SQL query. The changes to this file, observed across multiple timestamps on January 21st and 22nd, 2026, reflect a detailed process of debugging and refining this complex SQL query:

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM:** The initial version includes a date range filter in the `base_contracts` Common Table Expression (CTE) and calculates `total_tax` using `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 1:37:28 PM:** The date range filter in `base_contracts` is temporarily commented out and replaced with a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'`, likely for focused testing on a single contract.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its inclusion in the `contract_tax_totals` calculation are commented out.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:** Modifications are made to how `TAX_AMOUNT` is summed in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, changing from `f.TAX_AMOUNT` to `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` (and `df.TAX_AMOUNT` for deed fees).
*   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM:** A case-sensitivity correction is applied to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` (changed to `'Interest'`), and a previous potential error in `deed_fee_tax` (using `cf.TAX_AMOUNT`) is corrected to `df.TAX_AMOUNT`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:** An attempt is made to explicitly cast `CONTRACT_ID` to `INT` within the `IN` subqueries for `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs (e.g., `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT))`).
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM:** The hardcoded contract number is changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM:** The explicit `CAST` syntax in the `IN` subqueries is slightly altered to a potentially incorrect form (`(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)`).
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM:** The `CAST` operation from the `IN` subqueries is reverted, returning to `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM - 4:27:46 PM:** There's a series of fragmented changes around the `cancelled_fee_tax_total` in `contract_tax_totals`, including an attempt to re-include it which would cause a SQL error as its CTE was commented out, followed by re-commenting it using a peculiar `//+` syntax.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter is removed, and the original date range filter `(CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}' OR EXISTS (...))` is restored.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM:** The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and all its references in `contract_tax_totals` are permanently removed. The final `SELECT` statement is fully provided, indicating a complete set of joined CTEs, including `item_counts`, `contract_writers`, `contract_net_prices`, and a `LEFT JOIN` to `dim_facility df`. This timestamp marks a significant cleanup and completion of the query structure.

### File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`

This service handles syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot. The changes on January 21st and 22nd, 2026, show intermittent debugging activities:

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** An initial version of the `syncPlotBoxData` method is present, which gathers data into batches for `primaryContactBatch`, `deceasedContactBatch`, `dealsBatch`, and `locationAssociations`. A `dd($dealsBatch);` (die and dump) debugging statement is active after data mapping and before processing.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement is removed, suggesting that debugging for the `dealsBatch` was completed.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM - 11:25:42 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement is reintroduced, indicating a revisit to debugging the deal batch processing.

### File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Hmis\HmisHubSpotService.php`

This service, similar to `PlotBoxHubSpotService`, integrates Hmis data with HubSpot, with a notable distinction for 'SHIPOUT' service types. Changes occurred on January 30th, 2026:

*   **1/30/2026, 3:02:18 PM:** The `syncData` method partitions data into regular and 'SHIPOUT' batches. A `dd($primaryContactBatch);` debug statement is present. The `processContacts` method includes calls to `checkContactOwnerExists` and `checkDealOwnerExists` for updates.
*   **1/30/2026, 3:50:31 PM:** No functional changes are observed.
*   **1/30/2026, 3:50:42 PM:** The `dd($primaryContactBatch);` statement in `syncData` is commented out, moving past initial debugging of this batch.
*   **1/30/2026, 4:06:43 PM - 4:08:13 PM:** A significant change occurs in the `processContacts` method where the entire code block for processing **primary contacts** (including searching, creating, and updating) is commented out. Concurrently, a new `dd($deceasedContactsToCreateOrUpdate);` is introduced within the deceased contacts processing block, indicating a shift in debugging focus to deceased contacts.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Intensive Debugging:** A prominent pattern across all modified files is the heavy use of commenting/uncommenting code blocks and `dd()` statements (in PHP) or hardcoding/commenting out `WHERE` clauses (in SQL). This suggests an active development phase focused on testing, isolating issues, and refining data synchronization logic.
*   **SQL Query Complexity and Refinement:** The `PlotBox\Contact.php` file's `getDataWithDateRange` method showcases an intricate SQL query with multiple CTEs and complex joins. The iterative changes indicate ongoing optimization, bug fixing (e.g., `TAX_AMOUNT` source, `CAST` issues), and feature adjustments (e.g., removing `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`).
*   **HubSpot Service Structure:** Both `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` follow a similar architectural pattern for HubSpot integration, processing contacts and deals in batches and managing associations to locations. Both services also incorporate `sleep()` calls, likely to mitigate HubSpot API rate limits or ensure previous operations complete.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Both HubSpot services include comprehensive `try-catch` blocks for robust error handling and extensively use `Log::error()` and `Log::info()` to record the sync process and any failures.
*   **Modular Design:** The use of mappers (`PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`, `HmisDataToCrmMapper`) and separate service classes (`HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`) implies a modular design for CRM integration.
*   **Chronological Iteration:** Changes are often close in time, reflecting rapid iterative development and testing cycles on specific components of the data pipeline.

## 3:08:01 AM
**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
*   **Timestamps:** This file saw extensive, rapid changes on 1/21/2026 between 12:51 PM and 4:27 PM, followed by a substantial refinement on 1/22/2026 at 11:24 AM.
*   **Key Updates:**
    *   **SQL Query Filtering:** The initial flexible date range filter in the `base_contracts` Common Table Expression (CTE) within the `getDataWithDateRange` method was repeatedly replaced with hardcoded contract numbers (`'645-110814'`, then `'110814'`) likely for debugging specific contract data. This hardcoded filter was eventually removed on 1/22/2026, restoring the original date-based filtering logic.
    *   **Tax Calculation Logic:** The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was consistently commented out. Errors were introduced and corrected in `contract_tax_totals` by briefly uncommenting the reference to `cancelled_fee_tax_total` while its source CTE was still commented. Additionally, the source of `TAX_AMOUNT` in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs was corrected, changing from a generic `f.TAX_AMOUNT` to `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` and `df.TAX_AMOUNT` respectively. A minor case sensitivity fix was also applied to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'`.
    *   **SQL Type Casting:** There were temporary attempts to introduce `CAST(... AS INT)` within `IN` subqueries in the tax calculation CTEs, which were subsequently reverted due to incorrect syntax or deemed unnecessary.
    *   **Final SELECT Statement Refinement:** The most significant structural improvement occurred on 1/22/2026. The final `SELECT` statement, which collects aggregated data, was refactored to explicitly use `LEFT JOIN` clauses for `deceased_contacts`, `contract_writers`, and `item_counts` CTEs. This improves clarity and ensures all intended output columns (`Private_Estates_Owned`, `Urns_Owned`, `Vaults_Owned`) are correctly present, which were previously truncated in the log output.
    *   **Purchase Price Coalescence:** The fallback logic for `Purchase_Price` calculation was simplified, removing `pc.TOTAL_CASH_PRICE` as an alternative in the `COALESCE` function.

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
*   **Timestamps:** Changes were recorded on 1/21/2026 at 12:54 PM and on 1/22/2026 between 11:19 AM and 11:25 AM.
*   **Key Updates:**
    *   **Debugging Statements:** The primary alterations involve repeatedly adding and then removing a `dd($dealsBatch);` debugging statement in the `syncPlotBoxData` method. This indicates an active process of debugging and testing the data synchronization logic at these specific points in time.

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Hmis\HmisHubSpotService.php`**
*   **Timestamps:** All changes to this file were made on 1/30/2026 between 3:02 PM and 4:08 PM.
*   **Key Updates:**
    *   **Debugging Flow Control:** Similar to `PlotBoxHubSpotService`, this service underwent debugging sessions marked by the presence and removal of `dd()` statements. Initially, `dd($primaryContactBatch);` was present in `syncData`. This was later commented out, and a new `dd($primaryContactsToCreateOrUpdate);` was introduced deeper within the `processContacts` method.
    *   **Temporary Code Disablement:** A significant change involved commenting out the entire "Primary Contacts" processing block within `processContacts`. This suggests a temporary focus on debugging other parts of the `processContacts` method, specifically shifting the debug breakpoint to `dd($deceasedContactsToCreateOrUpdate);`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Debugging Cycles:** A prevalent pattern is the frequent insertion, removal, or relocation of `dd()` (dump and die) statements across both HubSpot service files (`PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` and `HmisHubSpotService.php`). This clearly indicates an iterative development and debugging workflow.
*   **SQL Query Iteration:** In `PlotBox\Contact.php`, there's a recurring pattern of continuous refinement and correction within the complex SQL query, focusing on filtering, tax calculations, and the overall output structure. The use of temporary hardcoded filters in the SQL points to isolated testing.
*   **Commented-Out Code:** The frequent commenting and uncommenting of specific SQL CTEs or entire PHP code blocks (like the primary contact processing) suggests active experimentation or temporary disabling of functionalities during development or debugging.
*   **Chronological Proximity of Changes:** The changes for `Contact.php` are tightly grouped on one day, and similarly for `HmisHubSpotService.php` on another. This indicates concentrated work sessions on specific components.
*   **HubSpot Integration Logic:** Both `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` share a common architectural approach for syncing data to HubSpot, involving distinct processing for primary contacts, deceased contacts, deals, and location associations, often separated by "SHIPOUT" versus regular transactions in the HMIS service. Both services log processing steps and errors.

## 3:08:14 AM
The changes log details the development and refinement of a Paymentus data export feature within the `es_integration_hub` application, utilizing Laravel's command, action, job, service, and model components, primarily interacting with a Snowflake data warehouse.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\app.php`**
    *   **2/3/2026, 5:13:46 PM**: The application's default timezone was updated from 'UTC' to 'America/New_York'.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\database.php`**
    *   **2/4/2026, 11:18:26 AM**: Multiple new default database connections were added for `sims`, `home_office`, `contract_margin`, `hmis`, and `hmis_test`. Corresponding detailed connection configurations for `sims`, `corpstruct`, `keyserver`, `home_office`, `contract_margin`, `sqlsrv` (MSSQL), and `carlib` (DB2 via ODBC) were introduced. Subsequent entries for this file (2/4/2026, 11:20:46 AM to 11:26:31 AM) appear to be saves without functional changes.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Console\Commands\Integrations\PaymentusExportCommand.php`**
    *   **2/4/2026, 1:11:46 PM**: An initial console command `hub:paymentus-export-command` was created with a placeholder description.
    *   **2/4/2026, 3:23:58 PM**: The command's description was updated to explicitly state its purpose: "Export payments data from PlotBox, HMIS and Carlib to Paymentus in a CIF file".
    *   **2/4/2026, 4:47:21 PM**: The `handle` method was modified to include calls to an `ExportPaymentusData` action.
    *   **2/4/2026, 5:19:57 PM**: The `ExportPaymentusData` action was injected into the `handle` method.
    *   **2/4/2026, 5:20:26 PM**: The success message was enhanced to display the exported filename and line count.
    *   **2/4/2026, 5:23:09 PM**: The disk used for export was configured to use `config('filesystems.paymentus')`.
    *   **2/4/2026, 5:37:53 PM**: The batch size for export was configured to use `config('services.paymentus.export_batch_size')`.
    *   **2/4/2026, 5:42:59 PM**: The batch size configuration path was adjusted to `config('integrations.paymentus.export_batch_size')`. Subsequent entries (2/4/2026, 5:43:05 PM to 5:43:51 PM) show minor adjustments to this config retrieval.
    *   **2/5/2026, 2:33:38 PM**: The command's signature was changed to `hub:paymentus-export-file`.
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:18:40 PM**: The command began dispatching an `ExportPaymentusDataJob`, indicating a shift towards queueing export tasks.
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:26:17 PM**: The command was refactored to dispatch multiple `ExportPaymentusDataJob` instances in a loop for different data sources (plotbox, hmis, carlib), using a generic `DimContract` model and specified connections. It now reports job dispatch status rather than direct export results.
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:55:32 PM**: The `hmis` and `carlib` export entries were commented out, with a `TODO` to replace `DimContract` with specific models for those connections.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContract.php`**
    *   **2/4/2026, 1:16:04 PM**: This model was created, defining its connection (`snowflake`), table (`WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT`), primary key, and various relationships (`DimFacility`, `DimPaymentSchedule`, `DimPayment`, `DimContractOwner`). It also defined `casts` for boolean and date fields.
    *   **2/4/2026, 1:20:41 PM**: A complex `scopeForAccountExport` method was added to build a SQL query for Paymentus account data, involving multiple joins and calculated fields.
    *   **2/4/2026, 1:43:42 PM**: Significant adjustments were made to the `scopeForAccountExport` method, primarily to capitalize column names in the `select`, `join`, and `groupBy` clauses (e.g., `CONTRACT_NUMBER` instead of `contract_number`) and ensure consistent single-quoting for string literals within `DB::raw` expressions.
    *   **2/4/2026, 1:45:30 PM**: Further refinements to `scopeForAccountExport` involved using escaped double quotes (`\"`) for table aliases and column names within `DB::raw` expressions, likely to accommodate Snowflake's SQL parsing. This was slightly reverted and then standardized in subsequent commits on 2/4/2026, 1:48:14 PM and 1:49:19 PM to use double quotes (`"`) for aliases within `DB::raw`.
    *   **2/6/2026, 2:02:05 PM**: A `paid_and_full_date` cast was temporarily added, then removed (2/6/2026, 2:02:26 PM), and finally re-added (2/6/2026, 2:07:01 PM).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimFacility.php` (2/4/2026, 1:16:57 PM)**, **`DimPaymentSchedule.php` (2/4/2026, 1:17:32 PM, 1:17:39 PM)**, **`DimPaymentScheduleDetail.php` (2/4/2026, 1:18:16 PM)**, **`DimPayment.php` (2/4/2026, 1:18:48 PM)**, **`DimContractOwner.php` (2/4/2026, 1:19:18 PM)**, **`DimContact.php` (2/4/2026, 1:19:43 PM)**: These Eloquent models were created, each configured for the 'snowflake' connection and specific `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` tables, defining primary keys, timestamp settings, casts, and relationships to support the Paymentus data export.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Services\Paymentus\CsvExporter.php`**
    *   **2/4/2026, 4:54:28 PM**: This service was created to handle CSV file generation, including `initialize` (creating a temporary file and writing headers), `writeChunk` (inserting data batches), and `finalize` (saving to disk and cleaning up the temporary file). It defines a fixed set of 35 headers and a mapping logic.
    *   **2/4/2026, 4:56:55 PM**: Changed the CSV writer initialization method from `Writer::createFromPath` to `Writer::from`.
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:31:35 PM**: Modified `finalize` method to use the stored `$this->filename` for saving to disk instead of re-deriving it from the temporary path.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusData.php`**
    *   **2/4/2026, 4:49:29 PM (initial draft)**: This action was introduced to orchestrate the data export, utilizing `CsvExporter` and querying `DimContract` (initially `DimContact` in a later stage, then back to `DimContract`).
    *   **2/4/2026, 5:09:02 PM**: The generated filename format was updated to include `_CIF`.
    *   **2/4/2026, 5:12:50 PM**: The `execute` method was updated to perform chunked data processing, writing to CSV, and tracking line count.
    *   **2/4/2026, 5:14:22 PM**: The `finalize` step and return of `ExportResult` were properly integrated into `execute`.
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:14:22 PM**: The `execute` method was made more generic, accepting an Eloquent `Model` instance and updated to use `Log::debug` instead of `OutputStyle` for progress.
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:32:43 PM**: This action was significantly refactored to accept model class name, connection, and filename prefix as string arguments, allowing for dynamic database connection per model. It also incorporated detailed logging.
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:52:16 PM**: PHP DocBlocks were added to the `execute` method for clarity, and the `generateFilename` method was updated to use `sprintf` for better formatting with a dynamic prefix.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\DataTransferObjects\Paymentus\ExportResult.php`**
    *   **2/4/2026, 5:18:42 PM**: This `readonly` DTO was created to encapsulate the results of an export, including the `filename` and `lineCount`.
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:35:16 PM**: The `lineCount` property was renamed to `recordCount`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\filesystems.php`**
    *   **2/4/2026, 3:31:46 PM**: A new `paymentus` disk configuration was added, using the `local` driver and a root path defined by `PAYMENTUS_OUTGOING_FILE_PATH` environment variable.
    *   **2/4/2026, 4:28:08 PM**: The default `root` path for the `paymentus` disk was adjusted to ensure a trailing slash.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\integrations.php`**
    *   **2/4/2026, 5:40:44 PM**: This new configuration file was introduced to store Paymentus integration settings, including API details and an `export_batch_size`.
    *   **2/4/2026, 5:42:22 PM**: The Paymentus configuration was nested under a `paymentus` key.
    *   **2/4/2026, 5:42:36 PM**: The default `export_batch_size` was changed from 1000 to 500.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\bootstrap\app.php`**
    *   **2/5/2026, 2:25:10 PM**: The `ExportPaymentusData` action was initially registered as a command.
    *   **2/5/2026, 2:26:00 PM**: This was corrected to register `PaymentusExportCommand::class` as the console command.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\routes\console.php`**
    *   **2/5/2026, 2:34:09 PM**: A commented-out line was added to schedule the `hub:paymentus-export-file` command to run daily, indicating an intention for automated execution.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Jobs\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusDataJob.php`**
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:11:54 PM**: This queueable job was created to offload the export process, initially taking connection, disk, batch size, and output as constructor parameters.
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:28:40 PM**: The job's constructor was refactored to accept `modelClass`, `connection`, `filenamePrefix`, `disk`, and `batchSize` as string parameters. It also defined `tries` and `timeout` properties for queue management and integrated detailed logging for job lifecycle events.
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:47:01 PM**: The `handle` method was updated to include an `UploadToSftp` action, ensuring that exported files are transferred to an SFTP server after generation, with conditional logic to skip upload if no records were exported.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\UploadToSftp.php` (2/6/2026, 1:45:20 PM)**: This action was created to manage the secure transfer of generated files to an SFTP server. It includes logic to read the file from a local disk, put it on the SFTP disk, and then delete the local copy upon successful transfer, with comprehensive logging and error handling.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Paymentus Integration Suite:** A consistent pattern of developing a cohesive set of components (`Command`, `Action`, `Job`, `Service`, `Models`, `DTO`) specifically for a "Paymentus" integration is evident.
*   **Snowflake Database Usage:** All newly created Paymentus-related Eloquent models (`DimContract`, `DimFacility`, etc.) explicitly connect to a `snowflake` database and reference tables within `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS`, indicating a dedicated data source for this integration.
*   **CSV Export Standard:** The `CsvExporter` service establishes a standard format with 35 predefined headers and a mapping mechanism for exporting data. The filename consistently includes a timestamp and `_CIF`.
*   **Evolution to Asynchronous Processing:** The transition from direct command execution to dispatching queue jobs (`ExportPaymentusDataJob`) highlights a strategy to handle potentially long-running data exports asynchronously.
*   **Robust Logging:** The use of `Log::info`, `Log::debug`, and `Log::error` across actions and jobs demonstrates a strong emphasis on monitoring and debugging the integration process.
*   **Configuration-Driven Development:** The frequent use of `env()` and `config()` throughout the codebase for database connections, file paths, and batch sizes ensures flexibility and environment-specific adjustments.
*   **Database Query Quoting:** Repeated modifications to `DB::raw` expressions in `DimContract` to handle SQL identifier quoting (using `"` or `\"`) suggest addressing specific dialect requirements or nuances of the Snowflake database.

## 4:08:03 AM
The changes log details modifications across two primary code files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and two HubSpot integration service files, `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Hmis\HmisHubSpotService.php`.

### File-Specific Updates:

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**

This file, which defines an Eloquent model for contacts in a PlotBox system, primarily sees changes within its `getDataWithDateRange` static method. This method contains a complex SQL query designed to retrieve detailed contract and contact information from a Snowflake warehouse.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM:** The initial entry for this file shows a comprehensive SQL query. It pulls data from various `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` tables, calculating net prices and item counts (e.g., caskets, cremation products, markers) based on fee categories. The query initially filters for records updated within a specified date range and includes logic for `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 1:37:28 PM:** The SQL query is temporarily modified to filter `DIM_CONTRACT` by a specific contract number, `'645-110814'`, with the original date range and `EXISTS` conditions commented out. This change is consistent across multiple saves during this period, indicating focused testing or debugging for a particular contract.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` Common Table Expression (CTE) is commented out entirely, and its corresponding calculation is removed from the `contract_tax_totals` CTE. This suggests a decision to exclude cancelled fee taxes from the total tax calculation.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:** A correction is applied to the tax calculation logic within the `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs. The sum was updated from `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * ...)` to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * ...)` and `SUM(df.TAX_AMOUNT * ...)`, indicating a fix for using the correct tax amount column from the respective fee tables.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM:** A minor case correction is made in the `contract_fee_tax` CTE (`LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` changed to `'Interest'`). Another correction reverts `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` back to `SUM(df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` in `deed_fee_tax`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM - 4:20:28 PM:** An attempt is made to introduce `CAST(... AS INT)` around subqueries selecting `CONTRACT_ID` within `IN` clauses (e.g., `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT))`). During this time, the static contract filter also changes from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM:** The `CAST` syntax is further modified to `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)`, which appears syntactically incorrect for casting the entire subquery.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM:** The problematic `CAST` statements are reverted, removing the `AS INT` part from the subquery entirely, restoring the original `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` syntax.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM - 4:27:46 PM:** A brief, incorrect reintroduction of `cancelled_fee_tax_total` into `contract_tax_totals` occurs, even though the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE is commented out. This error is quickly rectified in the following commit.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM - 2/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM:** The temporary static contract number filter is commented out, and the original date range filtering logic for `base_contracts` is uncommented, restoring the method to its intended date-filtered operation. The full SQL `SELECT` statement is also consistently present without truncation in later entries.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**

This file manages the synchronization of PlotBox data to HubSpot.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** The initial state includes a `dd($dealsBatch)` call after data mapping, suggesting an active debugging phase. The service implements robust error handling with individual `try-catch` blocks for processing contacts, deals, and associations, along with `sleep` calls to manage API interactions.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` call is removed, indicating a step towards enabling the full sync process.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM - 11:25:42 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` call is re-introduced, implying further debugging or verification steps were necessary.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Hmis\HmisHubSpotService.php`**

This file handles the synchronization of Hmis data to HubSpot, featuring similar logic to the `PlotBoxHubSpotService` but with specific handling for "SHIPOUT" service types.

*   **1/30/2026, 3:02:18 PM:** The initial version includes a `dd($primaryContactBatch)` call within the `syncData` method. It defines separate batches for regular and "SHIPOUT" contacts and deals. The `processContacts` method is structured similarly to the PlotBox service, including `sleep` calls and individual `try-catch` blocks, and introduces `checkContactOwnerExists` and `checkDealOwnerExists` for updates.
*   **1/30/2026, 3:50:31 PM:** A `dd($primaryContactsToCreateOrUpdate)` call is added within the `processContacts` method, shifting the debugging focus to the results of the contact search before creation/update.
*   **1/30/2026, 3:50:42 PM:** The `dd($primaryContactBatch)` call in `syncData` is commented out, further narrowing the debugging scope to the `processContacts` internal logic.
*   **1/30/2026, 4:06:43 PM - 4:08:13 PM:** The entire `try-catch` block responsible for processing primary contacts within `processContacts` is commented out. Simultaneously, a `dd($deceasedContactsToCreateOrUpdate)` call is added within the deceased contact processing block, indicating an isolated debugging effort for deceased contacts.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM:** Initial complex SQL query in `PlotBox\Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM:** Introduction of static contract filtering for testing in `PlotBox\Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** Removal of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` logic in `PlotBox\Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM & 4:16:07 PM:** Corrections to tax amount calculations in `PlotBox\Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM - 4:26:14 PM:** Attempts and subsequent reverts of `CAST` operations on subqueries in `PlotBox\Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** Reversion to original date-based filtering in `PlotBox\Contact.php`, ending the focused testing.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** Removal of `dd()` debugging in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, indicating progression.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM:** Re-introduction of `dd()` debugging in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, suggesting further verification.
*   **1/30/2026, 3:02:18 PM:** Initial debugging with `dd()` in `HmisHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/30/2026, 3:50:31 PM - 4:08:13 PM:** Progressive changes in `HmisHubSpotService.php` commenting out code blocks and relocating `dd()` calls, demonstrating an iterative debugging process, likely isolating primary and deceased contact processing.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **Iterative Debugging:** Both HubSpot service files frequently use `dd()` (dump and die) calls, and these calls are moved or commented in and out, indicating an active, iterative debugging process. Large sections of code are commented out to isolate issues.
2.  **SQL Query Refinement:** The `PlotBox\Contact.php` file shows a continuous refinement of its embedded SQL query, including changes to filtering, calculation logic, and data type casting, often demonstrating testing with static values before reverting to dynamic date filters.
3.  **API Rate Limit Management:** Both `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` incorporate `sleep()` calls (e.g., `sleep(10)`, `sleep(5)`) between significant API operations (contact processing, deal processing), likely to comply with HubSpot API rate limits or allow for backend processing.
4.  **Resilient Processing:** Both HubSpot services use extensive `try-catch` blocks around distinct processing steps (primary contacts, deceased contacts, deals, associations). This design ensures that failures in one step do not halt the entire synchronization process, and errors are logged.
5.  **Service Abstraction:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` share a very similar structure and approach to integrating with HubSpot, indicating a common architectural pattern for handling CRM data synchronization from different internal systems.
6.  **Timestamp Grouping:** Changes are highly concentrated within specific hours on 1/21/2026 and 1/30/2026, suggesting intense, focused development or debugging sessions on those days.
7.  **Truncated Log Entries:** Many entries, particularly for `PlotBox\Contact.php`, show truncated code at the end of the `SELECT` statement in the SQL query, which is a log artifact rather than a code change. The full SQL appears in the last entry for that file.

## 4:08:07 AM
The log details a significant development effort focused on implementing a Paymentus data export feature within an `es_integration_hub` application, alongside general configuration adjustments.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\app.php`**:
    *   On **2/3/2026, 5:13:46 PM**, the application timezone was updated from 'UTC' to 'America/New_York'.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\database.php`**:
    *   On **2/4/2026, 11:18:26 AM**, the database configuration was extensively defined, introducing multiple connection profiles (`laravel`, `sims`, `corpstruct`, `keyserver`, `home_office`, `contract_margin`, `sqlsrv`, `carlib`) and mapping them to environment variables. This indicates a multi-database integration setup. Subsequent entries for this file between **11:20:46 AM and 11:26:31 AM** appear to be identical saves with no functional changes.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Console\Commands\Integrations\PaymentusExportCommand.php`**:
    *   Initially created on **2/4/2026, 1:11:46 PM** as a placeholder command.
    *   Its description was updated on **2/4/2026, 3:23:58 PM** to clearly state its purpose: "Export payments data from PlotBox, HMIS and Carlib to Paymentus in a CIF file".
    *   On **2/4/2026, 4:47:21 PM**, the command's `handle` method was populated to invoke an `ExportPaymentusData` action, indicating the core export logic was being integrated.
    *   Further refinements throughout **2/4/2026 (5:19 PM - 5:43 PM)** included injecting the `ExportPaymentusData` action, enhancing the success message with export file details, and externalizing `disk` and `batchSize` parameters to application configurations (`filesystems.paymentus` and `integrations.paymentus.export_batch_size`).
    *   The command's signature was changed from `hub:paymentus-export-command` to `hub:paymentus-export-file` on **2/5/2026, 2:33:38 PM**.
    *   A significant shift occurred on **2/6/2026 (1:18:40 PM - 1:27:37 PM)**, moving the export execution to a queued job (`ExportPaymentusDataJob`). The `handle` method was refactored to define multiple export sources (PlotBox, HMIS, Carlib, though HMIS and Carlib models were commented out for a period) and dispatch a separate job for each, transforming the command into a job dispatcher.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContract.php`**:
    *   Created on **2/4/2026, 1:16:04 PM**, defining an Eloquent model for Snowflake, connecting to `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT`. It includes various relationships (facility, payment schedules, payments, contract owners).
    *   A crucial `scopeForAccountExport` method was added on **2/4/2026, 1:20:41 PM**, which constructs a complex SQL query involving multiple joins (facilities, payment schedules, payments, contract owners, contacts) and selects numerous fields for account export, including calculated amounts due and contact details.
    *   Subsequent changes (from **2/4/2026, 1:36:11 PM to 1:49:19 PM**) focused heavily on refining the SQL query within `scopeForAccountExport`, particularly adjusting quote usage (single quotes, double quotes, and escaped double quotes `\"`) for table aliases and string literals to ensure compatibility with the Snowflake database driver.
    *   On **2/6/2026, 2:02:05 PM**, a `paid_and_full_date` cast was added, then removed on **2/6/2026, 2:02:26 PM**, and finally re-added on **2/6/2026, 2:07:01 PM**.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimFacility.php`**, **`DimPaymentSchedule.php`**, **`DimPaymentScheduleDetail.php`**, **`DimPayment.php`**, **`DimContractOwner.php`**, **`DimContact.php`**:
    *   These models were all created around **2/4/2026, 1:16 PM - 1:19 PM**. They are Eloquent models for the Snowflake database, connecting to specific tables within `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` and defining relationships relevant to contract and payment data.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Services\Paymentus\CsvExporter.php`**:
    *   Introduced on **2/4/2026, 4:54:28 PM**. This service handles the core logic of writing data to a CSV file. It initializes the CSV writer, defines headers, writes data in chunks, and finalizes the file by storing it on a specified disk.
    *   A minor update on **2/4/2026, 4:56:55 PM** changed `Writer::createFromPath` to `Writer::from`.
    *   On **2/6/2026, 1:31:35 PM**, a class property `$filename` was added to store the target filename for use during `finalize`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusData.php`**:
    *   Evolved throughout **2/4/2026, 5:06 PM - 5:16 PM**. It began as a placeholder, then gained logic for generating filenames (appending `_CIF`), initializing the `CsvExporter`, and performing the data query, chunking, and writing. There was a brief period on **2/4/2026, 5:12 PM - 5:15 PM** where `DimContact` was incorrectly used instead of `DimContract` for the main query, which was later corrected.
    *   On **2/6/2026, 1:14:22 PM**, it was refactored to accept a generic `Model $model` instead of a hardcoded `DimContract`, making it reusable.
    *   Further genericization on **2/6/2026, 1:32:43 PM - 1:52:54 PM** changed parameters to `modelClass` (string), `connection` (string), and `filenamePrefix` to enable dynamic model instantiation and connection switching. Detailed PHPDoc comments were added, and logging (`Log::info`, `Log::debug`) was integrated. The `generateFilename` method was updated to incorporate the prefix.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\filesystems.php`**:
    *   On **2/4/2026, 3:31:46 PM**, a new `paymentus` disk configuration was added, using a 'local' driver and configurable root path for outgoing files. A minor path adjustment (trailing slash) was made on **2/4/2026, 4:28:08 PM**.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\DataTransferObjects\Paymentus\ExportResult.php`**:
    *   Created on **2/4/2026, 5:18:42 PM** as a `readonly` DTO to encapsulate the `filename` and `lineCount` (later `recordCount`) of an export operation. Renamed `lineCount` to `recordCount` on **2/6/2026, 1:35:16 PM**.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\integrations.php`**:
    *   Created on **2/4/2026, 5:40:44 PM** to store Paymentus-specific integration settings, including API details and an `export_batch_size`.
    *   On **2/4/2026, 5:42:22 PM**, the configuration was nested under a `paymentus` key. The default `export_batch_size` was adjusted from 1000 to 500 on **2/4/2026, 5:42:36 PM**.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\bootstrap\app.php`**:
    *   On **2/5/2026, 2:26:00 PM**, the `PaymentusExportCommand` was correctly registered as a command, replacing an earlier, incorrect registration of the `ExportPaymentusData` action.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\routes\console.php`**:
    *   On **2/5/2026, 2:34:09 PM**, a commented-out entry for scheduling the `hub:paymentus-export-file` command daily was added, indicating future plans for automated exports.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Jobs\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusDataJob.php`**:
    *   Created on **2/6/2026, 1:11:54 PM**. This `ShouldQueue` job was introduced to handle the Paymentus data export asynchronously.
    *   It underwent several iterations on **2/6/2026, 1:14 PM - 1:29 PM**, evolving its constructor parameters to be more flexible (`modelClass`, `connection`, `filenamePrefix`, `disk`, `batchSize`), adding queue properties (`tries`, `timeout`), and integrating detailed `Log::info` messages for process tracking and a `failed` method for error handling.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\UploadToSftp.php`**:
    *   Created on **2/6/2026, 1:45:20 PM**. This action provides functionality to upload a specified file from a local disk to an SFTP disk, including logging and error handling.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Paymentus Integration Focus**: The predominant pattern is the development of a comprehensive Paymentus integration, particularly for exporting data. This involves multiple architectural components: a console command, a queued job, a service for CSV generation, an action for the export logic, and another action for SFTP upload.
*   **Modularity and Reusability**: Early changes show a move towards making the export logic more generic and reusable by passing model classes, connections, and prefixes, rather than hardcoding them within the action.
*   **Configuration Driven**: There's a clear emphasis on managing settings through configuration files (`app.php`, `database.php`, `filesystems.php`, `integrations.php`) and environment variables, allowing for flexible deployment across different environments.
*   **Snowflake Database Integration**: A recurring theme is the use of Snowflake as a data source, with specific model configurations and careful handling of SQL quoting within queries (e.g., escaped double quotes `\"` for identifiers).
*   **Asynchronous Processing**: The introduction of queueable jobs indicates a design decision to offload long-running export tasks to background processes, improving application responsiveness.
*   **Detailed Logging**: `Log::info` and `Log::debug` calls are strategically placed within actions and jobs to provide visibility into the export process stages and record counts.
*   **File Naming Conventions**: Exported files consistently follow a `paymentus_{prefix}_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}_CIF.csv` pattern.

## 5:07:56 AM
The provided log details significant development activity across two primary files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, with additional entries for `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Hmis\HmisHubSpotService.php`. The timestamps consistently fall within January 21st and 22nd, 2026, and January 30th, 2026, indicating focused work periods.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM**: The initial state of the `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query included date range filtering for contract and contact last updated dates, an optional `Approved` status filter for production, and detailed CTEs for `payment_schedule_totals`, `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`, `contract_tax_totals`, `contract_net_prices`, `contract_writers`, `item_counts`, `primary_contacts`, and `deceased_contacts`.
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 1:37:28 PM**: The date range filtering in `base_contracts` was temporarily commented out and replaced with a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'`, suggesting debugging or testing with a specific contract.
    *   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM**: The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its reference in `contract_tax_totals` were commented out, simplifying the tax calculation logic.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM**: A potential bug was introduced where `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` and `df.TAX_AMOUNT` were incorrectly used for summing in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, instead of `f.TAX_AMOUNT` from the joined `DIM_FEE` table. Also, the `FEE_TYPE` comparison case was slightly altered. The hardcoded contract number filter remained `'645-110814'`.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM**: The tax amount calculation was corrected back to `f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY` and `f.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY`, reversing the previous error.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM**: Explicit `CAST(... AS INT)` operations were added to the `CONTRACT_ID IN (SELECT ...)` subqueries within tax calculation CTEs, likely for type safety or performance.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM - 4:20:28 PM**: The hardcoded contract number for testing was changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM**: A syntax error was introduced in the `deed_fee_tax` CTE's `WHERE IN` clause by omitting a parenthesis around the `SELECT` subquery for the `CAST` operation.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM**: The `CAST(... AS INT)` operations were removed from the `CONTRACT_ID IN` subqueries, reverting to the simpler syntax and fixing the syntax error from 4:23:56 PM.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM**: A bug was introduced in `contract_tax_totals` by incorrectly referencing `cft.cancelled_fee_tax_total` instead of `ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total`, while `ccft` was commented out.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM - 4:27:46 PM**: This bug was fixed by commenting out the reference to `cancelled_fee_tax_total` in `contract_tax_totals` to align with the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM**: The hardcoded contract number filter was commented out, and the original dynamic date range filtering for contracts and contacts was reactivated. The end of the query was truncated.
    *   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM**: The query truncation at the end was resolved, restoring the full `SELECT` list and `LEFT JOIN` clauses.

2.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM**: The `syncPlotBoxData` method included a `dd($dealsBatch)` statement, halting execution for debugging. The `processContacts` method was structured with `try-catch` blocks and `sleep` calls (10s and 5s) for HubSpot API interactions.
    *   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM**: The `dd($dealsBatch)` call was removed, allowing the sync process to complete.
    *   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM**: The `dd($dealsBatch)` call was re-added, effectively reverting the previous change and resuming debugging.

3.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Hmis\HmisHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **1/30/2026, 3:02:18 PM**: The `syncData` method was designed to process Hmis data, segregating it into 'SHIPOUT' and other service types. It included a `dd($primaryContactBatch)` in `syncData`. The `processContacts` method implemented similar HubSpot sync logic to `PlotBoxHubSpotService`, including `checkContactOwnerExists` and `checkDealOwnerExists` helper methods.
    *   **1/30/2026, 3:50:31 PM**: A `dd($primaryContactsToCreateOrUpdate)` call was added inside the `processContacts` method, focusing debugging on primary contact search results.
    *   **1/30/2026, 3:50:42 PM**: The `dd($primaryContactBatch)` in `syncData` was commented out, but the `dd($primaryContactsToCreateOrUpdate)` in `processContacts` remained active.
    *   **1/30/2026, 4:06:43 PM**: The entire primary contacts processing block in `processContacts` was commented out. A new `dd($deceasedContactsToCreateOrUpdate)` was introduced, shifting the debugging target to deceased contacts.
    *   **1/30/2026, 4:08:13 PM**: No functional change; the debugging setup for deceased contacts remained.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Frequent Debugging (`dd()` calls)**: Both `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` and `HmisHubSpotService.php` show a recurring pattern of adding or commenting/uncommenting `dd()` statements (dump and die) at various points in their `syncData` and `processContacts` methods. This indicates active, iterative debugging of the data synchronization and CRM interaction logic.
*   **SQL Query Iteration and Refinement**: The `Contact.php` file demonstrates a pattern of modifying a complex SQL query for specific testing (hardcoding `CONTRACT_NUMBER`), introducing and fixing syntax or logic errors related to tax calculations and `CAST` operations, and then reverting to dynamic filtering. This suggests a continuous process of building, testing, and refining the data extraction query.
*   **HubSpot API Interaction Logic**: Both `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` share a common structure for interacting with HubSpot: fetching data, mapping it, batching contacts (primary/deceased) and deals, searching existing CRM records, creating/updating them, and then creating associations, including associating contacts and deals with locations.
*   **Resilience and Logging**: The `processContacts` methods in both HubSpot service files consistently use `try-catch` blocks around individual processing steps (primary contacts, deceased contacts, deals, associations) and log errors using `Log::error`. This indicates a design for robust error handling during synchronization.
*   **Rate Limiting**: The inclusion of `sleep(10)` and `sleep(5)` calls in the `processContacts` methods of both HubSpot services suggests a common strategy to manage API rate limits or allow for asynchronous data propagation in the CRM system.
*   **Data Segmentation (Hmis only)**: The `HmisHubSpotService` uniquely segments data into "SHIPOUT" and non-"SHIPOUT" types, processing them in separate batches, indicating a specific business logic requirement for Hmis data.

## 5:08:06 AM
The provided log details significant development activity focused on establishing a Paymentus integration for an application named `es_integration_hub`, particularly involving data export functionalities and extensive database configuration.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\app.php`**: On **2/3/2026, 5:13:46 PM**, the application's default timezone was changed from 'UTC' to 'America/New_York'.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\database.php`**: Starting **2/4/2026, 11:18:26 AM**, this file underwent multiple updates. Initially, it expanded the default database connections to include `sims_connection`, `home_office_connection`, `contract_margin_connection`, `hmis_connection`, and `hmis_test_connection`. It then configured detailed connection settings for various database types, including several MySQL instances (`laravel`, `sims`, `corpstruct`, `keyserver`, `home_office`, `contract_margin`), `sqlsrv` (for MSSQL), and `carlib` (for DB2/iSeries via ODBC). Subsequent changes within a short timeframe (11:20 AM - 11:26 AM) appear to be minor saves without functional content alterations.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Console\Commands\Integrations\PaymentusExportCommand.php`**:
    *   On **2/4/2026, 1:11:46 PM**, a new Artisan command `hub:paymentus-export-command` was created.
    *   By **2/4/2026, 3:23:58 PM**, its description was updated to `Export payments data from PlotBox, HMIS and Carlib to Paymentus in a CIF file`.
    *   Between **2/4/2026, 4:47:21 PM and 5:43:51 PM**, the command's `handle` method was developed to invoke an `ExportPaymentusData` action, passing disk, batch size, and output parameters. There were several refinements, including modifying the success message, dynamically loading the `disk` from `config('filesystems.paymentus')`, and fetching `batchSize` from `config('integrations.paymentus.export_batch_size')`.
    *   Major refactoring occurred from **2/6/2026, 1:18:40 PM** onwards, shifting the export logic to be dispatched as queued jobs (`ExportPaymentusDataJob`). The command was updated to dispatch multiple jobs, one for each data source (`plotbox`, `hmis`, `carlib`), using `App\Models\Paymentus\DimContract` as the initial model, although 'hmis' and 'carlib' sources were later commented out for a `TODO` for model replacement. The command's signature was changed to `hub:paymentus-export-file` on **2/5/2026, 2:33:38 PM**.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContract.php`**: This model for `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT` (Snowflake) was introduced on **2/4/2026, 1:16:04 PM**, defining various relationships (`facility`, `paymentSchedules`, `payments`, `contractOwners`, `primaryContractOwner`) and type casts. A significant update on **2/4/2026, 1:20:41 PM** introduced a `scopeForAccountExport` method, containing a complex SQL query that joins multiple dimension tables to extract comprehensive contract and customer data for the Paymentus export. Subsequent changes (until **2/4/2026, 1:49:19 PM**) focused on refining the SQL query's syntax, specifically standardizing uppercase column names and correctly quoting table aliases within `DB::raw` expressions for Snowflake compatibility. A `paid_and_full_date` cast was briefly added and re-added on **2/6/2026, 2:07:01 PM**.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimFacility.php`**: A new model for `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_FACILITY` with a `contracts()` relationship was added on **2/4/2026, 1:16:57 PM**.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimPaymentSchedule.php`**: Introduced on **2/4/2026, 1:17:32 PM**, and quickly updated on **2/4/2026, 1:17:39 PM** to include `contract()` and `details()` relationships.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimPaymentScheduleDetail.php`**: Created on **2/4/2026, 1:18:16 PM**, with a `COMPLETED_DATE` cast and `paymentSchedule()` relationship.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimPayment.php`**: Created on **2/4/2026, 1:18:48 PM**, with a `payment_date` cast and `contract()` relationship.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContractOwner.php`**: Created on **2/4/2026, 1:19:18 PM**, defining `contract()` and `contact()` relationships.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContact.php`**: Created on **2/4/2026, 1:19:43 PM**, including a `NON_MAILABLE_ADDRESS` cast and a `contractOwners()` relationship.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\filesystems.php`**: A new `paymentus` disk configuration was added on **2/4/2026, 3:31:46 PM**, defaulting to a local storage path for outgoing files. A minor path adjustment (trailing slash) was made on **2/4/2026, 4:28:08 PM**.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Services\Paymentus\CsvExporter.php`**: On **2/4/2026, 4:54:28 PM**, this new service was created to handle the generation of CSV files for Paymentus, including defining headers and mapping record data to rows. It was updated on **2/4/2026, 4:56:55 PM** to use `Writer::from` instead of `Writer::createFromPath`. On **2/6/2026, 1:31:35 PM**, it was refactored to store the final filename internally for use during the `finalize` step.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusData.php`**: This action, first appearing fully formed on **2/4/2026, 4:49:29 PM** (in a temporary file), orchestrates the data export by querying `DimContract`, using `CsvExporter` for file writing, and generating unique filenames. Numerous changes (from **2/4/2026, 5:06:09 PM to 5:16:01 PM**) refined the filename generation, the `CsvExporter` initialization, and corrected the model used for the query from `DimContact` back to `DimContract`. From **2/6/2026, 1:14:22 PM** onwards, it was significantly refactored to accept a dynamic `modelClass`, `connection`, and `filenamePrefix` for more flexible data sourcing, and `Log` statements were introduced.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\DataTransferObjects\Paymentus\ExportResult.php`**: A new `ExportResult` DTO was created on **2/4/2026, 5:18:42 PM** to encapsulate export metadata. On **2/6/2026, 1:35:16 PM**, the `lineCount` property was renamed to `recordCount`.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\integrations.php`**: A new configuration file was introduced on **2/4/2026, 5:40:44 PM** to manage Paymentus-specific settings, including API details and `export_batch_size`. The structure was refined on **2/4/2026, 5:42:22 PM** to nest Paymentus settings under a dedicated `paymentus` key, and the default `export_batch_size` was adjusted to 500 on **2/4/2026, 5:42:36 PM**.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\bootstrap\app.php`**: On **2/5/2026, 2:26:00 PM**, `PaymentusExportCommand::class` was registered as a console command for the application.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\routes\console.php`**: On **2/5/2026, 2:34:09 PM**, a scheduled execution of `hub:paymentus-export-file` was commented out.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Jobs\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusDataJob.php`**: This new `ShouldQueue` job, introduced on **2/6/2026, 1:11:54 PM**, handles the Paymentus data export asynchronously. It evolved quickly, eventually (`2/6/2026, 1:28:40 PM`) supporting dynamic `modelClass`, `connection`, `filenamePrefix`, `disk`, and `batchSize` parameters, along with queue configuration (`tries`, `timeout`) and integrated logging. On **2/6/2026, 1:47:01 PM**, it was enhanced to automatically trigger an SFTP upload of the generated file if records were exported, using a new `UploadToSftp` action.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\UploadToSftp.php`**: A new action dedicated to SFTP file uploads was created on **2/6/2026, 1:45:20 PM**, including logging and error handling.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **2/3/2026, 5:13 PM**: Initial configuration of application timezone.
*   **2/4/2026, 11:18 AM - 11:26 AM**: Extensive setup of multiple database connections in `database.php`.
*   **2/4/2026, 1:11 PM - 1:20 PM**: Creation of Paymentus-related Eloquent models for various data dimensions (`DimContract`, `DimFacility`, `DimPaymentSchedule`, etc.).
*   **2/4/2026, 1:20 PM**: Introduction of a complex `scopeForAccountExport` query in `DimContract.php` for Paymentus data preparation.
*   **2/4/2026, 1:45 PM**: Refinement of SQL query quoting in `DimContract.php` for database compatibility.
*   **2/4/2026, 3:31 PM**: Configuration of a dedicated `paymentus` filesystem disk.
*   **2/4/2026, 4:47 PM - 5:43 PM**: Development and refinement of the `PaymentusExportCommand` and `ExportPaymentusData` action.
*   **2/4/2026, 5:40 PM**: Introduction of `integrations.php` for Paymentus-specific settings.
*   **2/5/2026, 2:25 PM - 2:34 PM**: Command registration and commenting out a scheduled command.
*   **2/6/2026, 1:11 PM - 1:55 PM**: Major architectural shift to queued jobs (`ExportPaymentusDataJob`), dynamic model/connection handling for export, and integration of SFTP upload logic.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Paymentus Integration Focus**: The overarching theme is the development of a Paymentus integration, encompassing data models, an export command, an export action, a CSV exporter, a queued job, and configuration settings.
*   **Snowflake Database**: The core data source for the Paymentus export is identified as Snowflake, with models (`DimContract`, `DimFacility`, etc.) explicitly configured for a 'snowflake' connection and tables within the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` schema.
*   **Configuration-Driven Development**: There is a clear pattern of externalizing configuration parameters (e.g., database credentials, file paths, batch sizes) into `.env` files and configuration files (`app.php`, `database.php`, `filesystems.php`, `integrations.php`).
*   **Modular Architecture (Actions, Services, Jobs, DTOs)**: The code adheres to a modular pattern by separating concerns into distinct classes: `Commands` (user interface), `Actions` (business logic), `Services` (utility/helper logic), `Jobs` (asynchronous execution), and `DataTransferObjects` (data structures).
*   **Data Export Process**: A consistent pattern for data export is established: query data, chunk records, write to a temporary CSV, then finalize by moving to a configured storage disk, followed by SFTP upload.
*   **SQL Query Refinement**: The iterative changes to the `scopeForAccountExport` method, particularly regarding `DB::raw` expressions and quoting, indicate a focused effort on ensuring correct and performant SQL generation for the target database.
*   **Dynamic Source Handling**: The evolution of `ExportPaymentusData` and `ExportPaymentusDataJob` to accept model classes and connections dynamically highlights a design goal for reusability across multiple data sources (PlotBox, HMIS, Carlib).
*   **Logging for Observability**: Extensive logging (`Log::info`, `Log::debug`, `Log::error`) is incorporated into the export and SFTP processes to provide visibility into the execution flow and aid in debugging.

## 7:08:12 AM
The log details changes across two primary functional areas: a Laravel Eloquent model for PlotBox contacts (`Contact.php`) and two HubSpot integration services (`PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` and `HmisHubSpotService.php`).

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**:
    *   **Initial State (1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM):** The file defines a `Contact` model with relationships and a `getDataWithDateRange` method. This method executes a complex Snowflake SQL query using multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to aggregate contact, contract, payment, fee, and item-level data. Key aspects include dynamic date range filtering and a conditional 'Approved' status filter for production environments.
    *   **SQL Query Development & Debugging (1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 4:29:42 PM):**
        *   The dynamic date range filter in the `base_contracts` CTE was replaced with a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` (e.g., `'645-110814'`, then `'110814'`), indicating a shift to testing specific contracts.
        *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its inclusion in the `total_tax` calculation were first commented out, then explicitly removed from the calculation.
        *   Modifications were made to the source of `TAX_AMOUNT` in `SUM` functions for `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs (switching between `f.TAX_AMOUNT` and `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` or `df.TAX_AMOUNT`).
        *   Attempts were made to `CAST` subqueries to `INT` for `CONTRACT_ID` filtering, which resulted in syntax errors and were subsequently reverted.
        *   Throughout this period, the SQL query in the log entries was consistently truncated at the end, hiding parts of the `SELECT` and `FROM`/`JOIN` clauses.
    *   **SQL Query Refactor & Finalization (1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM):**
        *   The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter was commented out, and the original dynamic date range filtering logic was fully restored and uncommented.
        *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its calculation were definitively removed, streamlining the tax aggregation.
        *   The truncation issue in the log was resolved, showing the complete, restored SQL query including all `item_counts` and final `JOIN` clauses.
    *   **Subsequent Stability (1/22/2026, 11:25:33 AM - 2:29:50 PM):** No further functional changes were observed in this file, suggesting the SQL query reached a stable, intended state.

2.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**:
    *   This service handles syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot, involving `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`, and a data mapper.
    *   **Debugging Cycles (1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM - 1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM):** The presence and re-introduction of a `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging statement within the `syncPlotBoxData` method indicates intermittent debugging efforts, likely to inspect the data being prepared for HubSpot synchronization. The file also shows `sleep` calls for rate limiting and `try-catch` blocks for resilient error handling.

3.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Hmis\HmisHubSpotService.php`**:
    *   **Service Introduction & Initial Debugging (1/30/2026, 3:02:18 PM):** This new service, structurally similar to the `PlotBoxHubSpotService`, was introduced to sync HMIS data to HubSpot. It includes logic to categorize data into 'SHIPOUT' and non-'SHIPOUT' batches. It began with a `dd($primaryContactBatch)` debugging call and included new helper methods `checkContactOwnerExists` and `checkDealOwnerExists` for updates.
    *   **Focused Debugging (1/30/2026, 3:50:31 PM - 4:08:13 PM):**
        *   Debugging shifted with a `dd($primaryContactsToCreateOrUpdate)` being added after contact search.
        *   The `dd($primaryContactBatch)` in `syncData` was commented out.
        *   Critically, the entire processing block for "Primary Contacts" within `processContacts` was commented out, suggesting a temporary bypass or a major issue with that part of the logic.
        *   A `dd($deceasedContactsToCreateOrUpdate)` was then added inside the "Deceased Contacts" processing block, indicating a narrowed focus for debugging.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM:** Start of focused SQL query debugging in `PlotBox\Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE first commented out in `PlotBox\Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM & 4:16:07 PM:** Key adjustments to tax calculation fields in `PlotBox\Contact.php`.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM:** Major refactor and restoration of general functionality in `PlotBox\Contact.php` SQL.
*   **1/30/2026, 3:02:18 PM:** Introduction of `HmisHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/30/2026, 4:06:43 PM:** Primary contact processing temporarily disabled in `HmisHubSpotService.php` during debugging.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Debugging:** Frequent use of `dd()` (dump and die) statements, often moved or commented/uncommented, indicates an iterative, hands-on debugging process in both HubSpot services.
*   **SQL Query Evolution:** The `PlotBox\Contact.php` file demonstrates a pattern of active development and debugging within a large SQL query, including commenting out sections, changing filters for testing, and refining calculations.
*   **Standardized CRM Integration Service Structure:** Both `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` share a consistent architectural pattern for interacting with HubSpot, involving dedicated services for contacts, deals, and locations, along with mappers and robust `try-catch` error handling with logging.
*   **Resilience and Rate Limiting:** Both HubSpot services incorporate `try-catch` blocks for individual processing steps and `sleep()` calls, highlighting an emphasis on robust, rate-limited interaction with external APIs.
*   **Conditional Logic:** Logic is adapted based on application environment (`production` for SQL filter) and data characteristics (`SHIPOUT` service type for HMIS data).

## 7:08:15 AM
The changes log details the development of a Paymentus data export feature within the `es_integration_hub` application, spanning from initial configuration to the implementation of a robust, queue-driven export process.

**Key Information by File:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\app.php`**
    *   **2/3/2026, 5:13 PM:** The application's default timezone was updated from 'UTC' to 'America/New_York'.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\database.php`**
    *   **2/4/2026, 11:18 AM:** This file underwent significant expansion, adding multiple new database connection definitions beyond the default 'laravel' MySQL connection. Newly defined connections include `sims`, `home_office`, `contract_margin`, `corpstruct`, `keyserver` (all MySQL), `sqlsrv` (SQL Server), and `carlib` (DB2 iSeries ODBC). This indicates the integration hub is connecting to a diverse set of internal data sources. Subsequent entries for this file show no visible changes but indicate repeated saves within a short timeframe.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\filesystems.php`**
    *   **2/4/2026, 3:31 PM:** A new filesystem disk named `paymentus` was introduced. It uses the `local` driver, with its root path configurable via `PAYMENTUS_OUTGOING_FILE_PATH` environment variable, defaulting to `storage_path('app/paymentus')`.
    *   **2/4/2026, 4:28 PM:** A minor adjustment added a trailing slash to the default root path for the `paymentus` disk.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\integrations.php`**
    *   **2/4/2026, 5:40 PM:** A new configuration file was created for integrations. It initially defined `api` settings (base\_url, api\_key, timeout) and `export_batch_size`.
    *   **2/4/2026, 5:42 PM:** These settings were refactored and nested under a `paymentus` key for better organization. The `export_batch_size` default was also changed from 1000 to 500.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Console\Commands\Integrations\PaymentusExportCommand.php`**
    *   **2/4/2026, 1:11 PM:** The console command `hub:paymentus-export-command` was initially created as a placeholder.
    *   **2/4/2026, 3:23 PM:** Its description was updated to "Export payments data from PlotBox, HMIS and Carlib to Paymentus in a CIF file," indicating its purpose.
    *   **2/4/2026, 4:47 PM - 5:43 PM:** The command's `handle` method was progressively implemented to leverage an `ExportPaymentusData` action, passing filesystem disk and batch size configurations. It transitioned from an empty method to dispatching a specific export action.
    *   **2/5/2026, 2:33 PM:** The command's signature was changed to `hub:paymentus-export-file`.
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:18 PM - 1:27 PM:** The command's logic was significantly refactored to dispatch multiple `ExportPaymentusDataJob` instances. It defines an array of data sources (PlotBox, HMIS, Carlib), intending to create a job for each, although later revisions (1:55 PM) commented out HMIS and Carlib, focusing on PlotBox. The command now explicitly dispatches jobs and reports "Export jobs dispatched successfully."
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:55 PM:** `TODO` comments were added to remind about replacing `DimContract` with appropriate models for HMIS and Carlib, and those entries were temporarily commented out from the `$exports` array.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContract.php`**
    *   **2/4/2026, 1:16 PM:** This Eloquent model was introduced, connecting to the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT` table on the `snowflake` connection. It defines `casts` for boolean and date fields, and sets up `BelongsTo` and `HasMany` relationships to other Paymentus-related dimension models (Facility, PaymentSchedule, Payment, ContractOwner).
    *   **2/4/2026, 1:20 PM:** A complex `scopeForAccountExport` method was added. This method constructs a large SQL query involving multiple joins and `DB::raw` expressions to select and calculate various fields for the Paymentus export. It filters based on deletion status and contract status, and includes specific formatting for channel blocks and other fields.
    *   **2/4/2026, 1:36 PM - 1:49 PM:** Several iterations refined the SQL within `scopeForAccountExport`, primarily focusing on identifier casing (converting to uppercase for Snowflake compatibility) and consistent quoting within `DB::raw` expressions (using double quotes for table aliases and single quotes for string literals).
    *   **2/6/2026, 2:02 PM - 2:07 PM:** There were minor additions and subsequent reversions/re-additions of `paid_and_full_date` to the `casts` array, indicating refinement of data type handling.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimFacility.php`, `DimPaymentSchedule.php`, `DimPaymentScheduleDetail.php`, `DimPayment.php`, `DimContractOwner.php`, `DimContact.php`**
    *   **2/4/2026, 1:16 PM - 1:19 PM:** These files were created to define basic Eloquent models for various Paymentus-related dimension tables in the `snowflake` database. They include table and primary key definitions, data type casting, and relationships to other models in the `App\Models\Paymentus` namespace. `DimPaymentSchedule.php` had a quick fix to add missing `use` statements for relation types.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\DataTransferObjects\Paymentus\ExportResult.php`**
    *   **2/4/2026, 5:18 PM:** A `readonly` Data Transfer Object (DTO) called `ExportResult` was created to hold the `filename` and `lineCount` (later `recordCount`) of an export operation.
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:35 PM:** The property `lineCount` was renamed to `recordCount`.

*   **`response_9b4d8b3c-6aa0-4206-b090-23b852151025\1`** (Intermediate file for `ExportPaymentusData` action)
    *   **2/4/2026, 4:49 PM:** This file shows an early, complete version of the `ExportPaymentusData` action, demonstrating the core logic of fetching data, chunking, writing to CSV, and returning an `ExportResult`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Services\Paymentus\CsvExporter.php`**
    *   **2/4/2026, 4:54 PM:** This service was introduced to manage CSV file generation. It handles creating a temporary file, writing headers, inserting data in chunks, and moving the finalized CSV to the target disk before deleting the temporary file. It defines a fixed set of headers for the Paymentus export.
    *   **2/4/2026, 4:56 PM:** A minor internal API change for `League\Csv\Writer` was made (`createFromPath` to `from`).
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:31 PM:** Refinements were made to manage the filename internally and to update the return type hint for `mapRecordToRow`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusData.php`**
    *   **2/4/2026, 5:06 PM - 5:16 PM:** This action's implementation evolved to coordinate the CSV export. It initially used hardcoded filenames, then adopted a dynamic filename generated with a `_CIF.csv` suffix. It integrated `CsvExporter`, handled chunking, and tracked record counts. It was later corrected to use `DimContract` for the query, aligning with the model imports.
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:14 PM - 1:52 PM:** The `execute` method was refactored significantly to become more generic. It now accepts `modelClass`, `connection`, `filenamePrefix`, `disk`, and `batchSize` as arguments, allowing it to be reused for different data sources. It also added detailed logging using `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log` and standardized the filename generation using `sprintf`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\UploadToSftp.php`**
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:45 PM:** A new action was created to handle SFTP uploads. It reads a file from a specified local disk, uploads it to an 'sftp' disk, logs the process, and optionally deletes the local file upon successful upload.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Jobs\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusDataJob.php`**
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:11 PM:** This job was introduced to enable asynchronous execution of the Paymentus export.
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:14 PM - 1:29 PM:** It was refined to accept parameters like `modelClass`, `connection`, `filenamePrefix`, `disk`, and `batchSize`, making it flexible for different exports. It also included queue properties (`$tries`, `$timeout`) and comprehensive logging for job lifecycle (start, completion, failure).
    *   **2/6/2026, 1:47 PM:** The `UploadToSftp` action was integrated into this job's `handle` method, ensuring that after a successful data export to a local disk, the generated file is then uploaded to SFTP.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\bootstrap\app.php`**
    *   **2/5/2026, 2:25 PM:** The `PaymentusExportCommand` was registered within the application's console commands, making it executable via Artisan.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\routes\console.php`**
    *   **2/5/2026, 2:34 PM:** A commented-out line `Schedule::command('hub:paymentus-export-file')->dailyAt('02:00')->runInBackground();` was added, indicating the intent to schedule the Paymentus export command for daily execution.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Paymentus Integration:** The most prominent pattern is the dedicated development of the Paymentus integration, which drives the creation and evolution of various components (console command, actions, services, DTOs, models, jobs).
*   **Layered Architecture:** The changes demonstrate a clean architecture using Laravel conventions:
    *   **Commands:** For CLI interaction and dispatching jobs.
    *   **Jobs:** For background processing and robustness.
    *   **Actions:** For encapsulating business logic.
    *   **Services:** For specific functionalities (like CSV export).
    *   **Models:** For database interaction.
    *   **DTOs:** For structured data transfer.
*   **Database Connectivity and Configuration:** Extensive configuration for multiple database connections (MySQL, SQL Server, DB2, Snowflake) indicates a hub architecture integrating diverse systems.
*   **Snowflake Specifics:** The `DimContract` model, and implicitly other `Paymentus` models, target a Snowflake data warehouse, requiring specific SQL syntax considerations like uppercase column names and double quotes for identifiers in `DB::raw` expressions.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** The transition from direct command execution to dispatching `ExportPaymentusDataJob` highlights a move towards more scalable and fault-tolerant background processing.
*   **Logging:** Consistent use of `Log::info`, `Log::debug`, and `Log::error` across actions and jobs for better operational visibility and debugging.
*   **Environment-Driven Configuration:** Heavy reliance on `.env` files and Laravel's `config()` helper for externalizing sensitive and environment-specific settings.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The numerous timestamps clustered on 2/4/2026 for `database.php` and `DimContract.php` suggest active development, debugging, and refinement of database configurations and SQL queries.
*   **File Transfer:** The inclusion of `UploadToSftp` and its integration into the job signifies a complete data pipeline from extraction to external delivery.

In summary, the changes reflect a focused effort to build out a robust Paymentus data export feature, leveraging Laravel's ecosystem for database integration, background processing, file management, and configuration.

## 8:08:18 AM
The provided log details significant development activity within the `es_integration_hub` project, primarily focused on establishing a Paymentus data export functionality.

**File-Specific Updates:**

It introduced numerous new database connections, including `sims_connection`, `home_office_connection`, `contract_margin_connection`, `hmis_connection`, and `hmis_test_connection`. Detailed configurations for various database platforms like MySQL, SQL Server, and DB2 (for `carlib`) were added, many leveraging environment variables and specifying `migrations_path` for different connection types. Subsequent entries for this file show minor or no content changes, suggesting minor saves or edits that were later reverted.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Console\Commands\Integrations\PaymentusExportCommand.php`**: This console command evolved considerably over 2/4/2026 and 2/6/2026. Initially a placeholder, its description was updated, and it was refactored to delegate export logic to an `ExportPaymentusData` action. The command's signature was changed from `hub:paymentus-export-command` to `hub:paymentus-export-file` on 2/5/2026. A major architectural shift on 2/6/2026 involved converting the command to dispatch multiple `ExportPaymentusDataJob` instances, each configured for different data sources (e.g., 'plotbox', 'hmis', 'carlib'), indicating a move towards asynchronous processing. The entries for 'hmis' and 'carlib' were temporarily commented out with a placeholder `DimContract` model and a `TODO` for future replacement.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContract.php`**: This model was extensively developed starting on 2/4/2026 at 1:16 PM. It was configured to connect to a `snowflake` database for the `DIM_CONTRACT` table, defined several Eloquent relationships (`BelongsTo` to `DimFacility`, `HasMany` to `DimPaymentSchedule`, `DimPayment`, `DimContractOwner`), and set up casting for boolean and date fields. The most significant update was the addition of a complex `scopeForAccountExport` method, which generates a detailed SQL query for account export, including joins across multiple dimension tables, calculated fields, and filtering. Subsequent updates refined this query by standardizing column casing (e.g., `CONTRACT_NUMBER`) and adjusting quoting mechanisms within `DB::raw()` expressions. On 2/6/2026, a `paid_and_full_date` cast was added, briefly removed, and re-added.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimFacility.php`**: Created on 2/4/2026 at 1:16 PM, this model for `DIM_FACILITY` on `snowflake` defines a `HasMany` relationship to `DimContract`.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimPaymentSchedule.php`**: Created on 2/4/2026 at 1:17 PM, this `snowflake` model for `DIM_PAYMENT_SCHEDULE` was quickly updated to define `BelongsTo` and `HasMany` relationships to `DimContract` and `DimPaymentScheduleDetail`, respectively.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimPaymentScheduleDetail.php`**: Created on 2/4/2026 at 1:18 PM, this `snowflake` model for `DIM_PAYMENT_SCHEDULE_DETAIL` casts `COMPLETED_DATE` to a date and has a `BelongsTo` relationship to `DimPaymentSchedule`.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimPayment.php`**: Created on 2/4/2026 at 1:18 PM, this `snowflake` model for `DIM_PAYMENT` casts `payment_date` to a date and defines a `BelongsTo` relationship to `DimContract`.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContractOwner.php`**: Created on 2/4/2026 at 1:19 PM, this `snowflake` model for `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER` defines `BelongsTo` relationships to `DimContract` and `DimContact`.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContact.php`**: Created on 2/4/2026 at 1:19 PM, this `snowflake` model for `DIM_CONTACT` casts `NON_MAILABLE_ADDRESS` to boolean and includes a `HasMany` relationship to `DimContractOwner`.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\filesystems.php`**: On 2/4/2026 at 3:31 PM, a new `paymentus` local disk configuration was added for storing outgoing files, dynamically rooted via an environment variable. Minor adjustments to the default path followed.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Services\Paymentus\CsvExporter.php`**: This service, created on 2/4/2026 at 4:54 PM, is responsible for writing data to CSV files. It manages temporary file creation, defines a fixed set of 35 export headers, processes data in chunks, and finalizes the export by storing the file to a specified disk. A minor update to the `League\Csv` API call was made, and on 2/6/2026, it was enhanced to store the final filename internally for use during the `finalize` step.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusData.php`**: This action, first appearing on 2/4/2026 at 5:06 PM, encapsulates the core logic for Paymentus data export. It rapidly evolved from a skeleton to a fully functional action, handling dynamic filename generation, CSV initialization/finalization, and data querying. A key change involved switching the data source from `DimContact` to `DimContract`. On 2/6/2026 at 1:32 PM, it was made generic to accept a model class, database connection, and filename prefix as arguments, enabling reuse across different data sources. It also integrated logging and added verbose documentation comments.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\DataTransferObjects\Paymentus\ExportResult.php`**: Created on 2/4/2026 at 5:18 PM, this `readonly` DTO stores the `filename` and `lineCount` of an export. On 2/6/2026, `lineCount` was renamed to `recordCount`.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\integrations.php`**: This new configuration file was introduced on 2/4/2026 to manage Paymentus integration settings. Initially flat, its settings (API details, `export_batch_size`) were quickly nested under a `paymentus` key for better organization, and the default `export_batch_size` was adjusted from 1000 to 500.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\bootstrap\app.php`**: On 2/5/2026, this file was updated to correctly register the `PaymentusExportCommand` for console execution.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\routes\console.php`**: On 2/5/2026, a commented-out entry for scheduling the `hub:paymentus-export-file` command was added, indicating future automation plans.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Jobs\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusDataJob.php`**: This queue job was introduced on 2/6/2026 at 1:11 PM to handle Paymentus data exports asynchronously. It was quickly refined to accept model class, connection, filename prefix, disk, and batch size, making it highly configurable. It also gained retry/timeout settings and integrated `Log` statements for process monitoring and error handling.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\UploadToSftp.php`**: Created on 2/6/2026 at 1:45 PM, this new action provides functionality to securely upload files from local storage to an SFTP server, complete with logging and exception handling.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

The changes demonstrate a clear pattern of developing a new integration for "Paymentus," focusing on exporting data. This involves:
*   **Modular Design:** Extensive use of Laravel's architectural components (Console Commands, Actions, Services, Jobs, Eloquent Models, DTOs) to organize functionality.
*   **Snowflake Data Source:** The Paymentus integration consistently targets a Snowflake data warehouse, indicated by `protected $connection = 'snowflake'` and table prefixes like `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_`.
*   **Data Transformation and Export:** A common pattern involves complex SQL queries (via `scopeForAccountExport`) to extract and transform data, followed by CSV serialization (`CsvExporter`), and finally storage to a designated filesystem disk.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** A notable shift from direct command execution to dispatching queue jobs (`ExportPaymentusDataJob`) highlights a move towards robust, scalable, and background processing for data exports.
*   **Configurability:** Widespread use of `env()` variables and a new `integrations.php` config file ensures that various aspects of the export process (like batch size, file paths, database credentials) are easily configurable.
*   **File Naming Conventions:** Exported files consistently follow a timestamped `paymentus_{prefix}_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_CIF.csv` pattern.
*   **Logging and Error Handling:** `Log::info` and `Log::debug` statements, along with `failed()` methods in jobs, indicate a focus on monitoring and debugging the data export process.
*   **Database Connection Management:** The `ExportPaymentusData` action was made flexible to handle different database connections dynamically (`$model::on($connection)`), supporting various data sources (PlotBox, HMIS, Carlib).

## 9:08:12 AM
The changes primarily focus on developing and refining a Paymentus data export integration within a Laravel application. This involves setting up new models, a console command, an action, a queueable job, and a dedicated CSV export service, along with updating application and database configurations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\app.php`**
    *   On 2/3/2026, the application's default timezone was updated from 'UTC' to 'America/New_York'.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\database.php`**
    *   On 2/4/2026, extensive multi-database connection configurations were added or expanded. This includes new default connection names (`sims_connection`, `home_office_connection`, `contract_margin_connection`, `hmis_connection`, `hmis_test_connection`) and detailed connection setups for MySQL (sims, corpstruct, keyserver, home_office, contract_margin), MSSQL (sqlsrv), and DB2 (carlib). Several commented-out alternative ODBC/DB2 configurations indicate previous exploration.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Console\Commands\Integrations\PaymentusExportCommand.php`**
    *   Initial creation on 2/4/2026, 1:11:46 PM, as `hub:paymentus-export-command`.
    *   The command's description was updated to reflect its purpose: "Export payments data from PlotBox, HMIS and Carlib to Paymentus in a CIF file" (2/4/2026, 3:23:58 PM).
    *   The `handle` method evolved significantly:
        *   Initially, it called an `ExportPaymentusData` action directly (2/4/2026, 4:47:21 PM).
        *   It then integrated parameters like disk configuration and batch size from application settings (`config('filesystems.paymentus')`, `config('integrations.paymentus.export_batch_size')`) (2/4/2026, 5:23:09 PM - 5:43:18 PM).
        *   The command signature was changed to `hub:paymentus-export-file` (2/5/2026, 2:33:38 PM).
        *   A major refactoring occurred on 2/6/2026, 1:26:17 PM, where the command stopped executing the export directly. Instead, it now dispatches `ExportPaymentusDataJob` instances for different data sources (PlotBox, HMIS, Carlib) using a `DimContract` model and specific connection/prefix.
        *   The command's output was updated to confirm job dispatching rather than a direct export result (2/6/2026, 1:27:37 PM).
        *   Further changes commented out HMIS and Carlib exports and added a TODO for their model replacement (2/6/2026, 1:55:32 PM - 1:55:47 PM).
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimContract.php`**
    *   Created on 2/4/2026, 1:16:04 PM, as an Eloquent model for the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT` table on the 'snowflake' connection. It defines various relationships (facility, payment schedules, payments, contract owners).
    *   A crucial `scopeForAccountExport` method was added on 2/4/2026, 1:20:41 PM. This method constructs a complex SQL query involving multiple joins to gather detailed contract, facility, payment, and contact information, suitable for export.
    *   Subsequent changes (2/4/2026, 1:36:11 PM - 1:49:19 PM) involved extensive refinement of SQL syntax within `DB::raw` expressions in `scopeForAccountExport`, particularly concerning the quoting of table aliases and column names to ensure compatibility with Snowflake.
    *   The `$casts` array was temporarily updated and then reverted for a `paid_and_full_date` field (2/6/2026, 2:02:05 PM - 2:07:01 PM).
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Models\Paymentus\DimFacility.php`, `DimPaymentSchedule.php`, `DimPaymentScheduleDetail.php`, `DimPayment.php`, `DimContractOwner.php`, `DimContact.php`**
    *   These models were created sequentially on 2/4/2026 (between 1:16:57 PM and 1:19:43 PM), all connecting to `'snowflake'` and defining basic table mapping, primary keys, and relationships relevant to the Paymentus export data structure.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Services\Paymentus\CsvExporter.php`**
    *   Created on 2/4/2026, 4:54:28 PM. This service handles the initialization, chunked writing, and finalization of CSV files for export. It defines a fixed set of headers and a method to map record objects to CSV rows.
    *   Minor adjustments were made, such as changing `Writer::createFromPath` to `Writer::from` (2/4/2026, 4:56:55 PM) and retaining the filename for `finalize` (2/6/2026, 1:31:35 PM).
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusData.php`**
    *   Created on 2/4/2026, 5:06:09 PM. This action encapsulates the core logic for exporting Paymentus data.
    *   It was gradually refined to dynamically generate filenames (adding `_CIF.csv` suffix), receive export parameters (`disk`, `batchSize`), interact with the `CsvExporter`, and perform data fetching in chunks (2/4/2026, 5:09:02 PM - 5:16:01 PM).
    *   A significant update on 2/6/2026, 1:14:22 PM, made the `execute` method more generic by accepting a `Model $model` instance.
    *   Further refactoring on 2/6/2026, 1:32:43 PM, changed parameters to `modelClass` (string), `connection` (string), and `filenamePrefix` (string), allowing the action to dynamically connect to the correct database and model. It also integrated logging statements and updated filename generation.
    *   The query was corrected to specifically use the provided connection: `$modelClass::on($connection)->forAccountExport()` (2/6/2026, 1:50:32 PM). PHPDoc comments were added for clarity (2/6/2026, 1:52:16 PM).
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\DataTransferObjects\Paymentus\ExportResult.php`**
    *   Created on 2/4/2026, 5:18:42 PM, as a readonly Data Transfer Object to hold the `filename` and `lineCount` of an export. The `lineCount` property was later renamed to `recordCount` (2/6/2026, 1:35:16 PM).
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\filesystems.php`**
    *   On 2/4/2026, 3:31:46 PM, a new `paymentus` disk configuration was added, using the `local` driver and a configurable root path (`env('PAYMENTUS_OUTGOING_FILE_PATH')`). A trailing slash was added to the root path on 2/4/2026, 4:28:08 PM.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\config\integrations.php`**
    *   Created on 2/4/2026, 5:40:44 PM, to centralize Paymentus integration settings. It initially defined API parameters and an `export_batch_size`.
    *   The configuration was nested under a `paymentus` key on 2/4/2026, 5:42:22 PM, and the default `export_batch_size` was changed from 1000 to 500 (2/4/2026, 5:42:36 PM).
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\bootstrap\app.php`**
    *   On 2/5/2026, the `PaymentusExportCommand` was registered in the application's console commands.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\routes\console.php`**
    *   On 2/5/2026, 2:34:09 PM, a commented-out line `Schedule::command('hub:paymentus-export-file')->dailyAt('02:00')->runInBackground();` was added, indicating the intent to schedule the Paymentus export command.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Jobs\Paymentus\ExportPaymentusDataJob.php`**
    *   Created on 2/6/2026, 1:11:54 PM, as a queueable job (`ShouldQueue`) to handle Paymentus data export asynchronously.
    *   The job's constructor and `handle` method were significantly refactored on 2/6/2026, 1:28:40 PM. It now accepts `modelClass`, `connection`, `filenamePrefix`, `disk`, and `batchSize` as parameters, configures `tries` and `timeout`, uses `Log` for status updates, and includes a `failed` method for error handling.
    *   On 2/6/2026, 1:47:01 PM, an `UploadToSftp` action was injected and called after a successful export (if records were exported), handling the transfer of the generated CSV file.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\es_integration_hub\app\Actions\Paymentus\UploadToSftp.php`**
    *   Created on 2/6/2026, 1:45:20 PM. This action provides logic for securely uploading a file from a local storage disk to an SFTP server, including logging and optional deletion of the local file.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Paymentus Integration Focus**: A clear and consistent development theme is the implementation of a Paymentus data export feature. This is evident from the naming conventions (`PaymentusExportCommand`, `ExportPaymentusData`, `CsvExporter`, `ExportResult`, `ExportPaymentusDataJob`) and the files being created/modified.
*   **Snowflake Database**: The application is designed to interact with a Snowflake data warehouse, indicated by models connecting to `'snowflake'` and the specific SQL syntax (e.g., double quotes for identifiers) used in query scopes.
*   **Laravel Framework Utilization**: The changes extensively leverage Laravel's features, including Artisan commands, Eloquent ORM (models, relationships, query scopes), service containers (dependency injection in actions and jobs), queueing system, configuration management, and file storage.
*   **Modular Design**: The export process is broken down into modular components: a console command to initiate, a job for asynchronous processing, an action for core business logic (exporting data), a service for CSV formatting, and another action for SFTP upload.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: There's a noticeable pattern of iterative development and refactoring, particularly in the `PaymentusExportCommand` and `ExportPaymentusData` action, moving from basic implementations to more robust, configurable, and asynchronous solutions.
*   **Multi-Source Data Handling**: The `PaymentusExportCommand` indicates an intention to export data from multiple internal systems (PlotBox, HMIS, Carlib), suggesting a broader data integration hub.
*   **Configuration-Driven**: Many aspects of the export process, such as batch size and file paths, are configurable via application configuration files (`config/integrations.php`, `config/filesystems.php`), which in turn rely on environment variables.
*   **Logging**: Extensive logging (`Log::info`, `Log::debug`, `Log::error`) is incorporated into the job and action classes for better monitoring and debugging of the export process.
