# Activity Summary for 1/17/2026

## 12:33:08 AM
**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**

This file defines an Eloquent model for `Contact` in the `PlotBox` namespace, which interacts with a `Snowflake` database. It includes a `getDataWithDateRange` static method responsible for fetching comprehensive contract and contact details.

*   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM:** The SQL query within `getDataWithDateRange` was modified to use a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER IN('660-1004010262')` filter, commenting out the dynamic date range and `EXISTS` conditions, likely for specific debugging.
*   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** The SQL query was reverted to its original state, reactivating the date range and `EXISTS` conditions and removing the hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter. Notably, the `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` field was removed from the final `SELECT` list.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM:** The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter (`'660-1004010262'`) was re-introduced in the SQL query, and the `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` field was re-added to the `SELECT` statement. This indicates a cycle of debugging.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:15:07 PM - 5:00:46 PM:** The hardcoded contract number in the SQL query was repeatedly changed (`'Draft-4157894'`, `'Draft-4157884'`, `'623-1004011168'`, then back to `'660-1004010262'`), consistently indicating continued debugging efforts with various specific contract IDs.
*   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** The SQL query was again reverted to use the dynamic date range filter and `EXISTS` conditions, removing the hardcoded contract number filter.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** A `LIMIT 1` clause was added to the end of the SQL query, likely to restrict results for testing purposes.
*   **1/16/2026, 11:00:07 AM:** The `LIMIT 1` clause was removed from the SQL query.
*   **1/16/2026, 1:39:07 PM:** Introduced logic to conditionally add an `AND DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS = 'Approved'` filter to the SQL query's `base_contracts` CTE, applying it only when the application environment is 'production'. The date range conditions were enclosed in parentheses.
*   **1/16/2026, 1:44:28 PM - 2:04:29 PM:** This period shows debugging efforts related to the new production environment filter:
    *   A `dd($isProduction);` (die and dump) statement was added to inspect the environment variable.
    *   The column name for the contract status filter was changed from `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS` to `DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS`.
    *   The logic for applying the 'Approved' filter was briefly inverted (to apply when *not* in production) at 1:58 PM, then reverted to apply *only* in production at 2:04 PM, suggesting testing of the conditional logic.
    *   `dd($results);` was added to inspect query results.
*   **1/16/2026, 2:58:12 PM:** The debugging `dd()` statements were removed, signifying the conclusion of this debugging phase.

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**

This service is responsible for synchronizing PlotBox data to HubSpot CRM, handling contact, deal, and location associations.

*   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM:** A `dd($primaryContactBatch);` statement was added within the `syncPlotBoxData` method to debug the primary contact data being prepared for HubSpot. The file content was truncated at the end of the `processContacts` method.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:52:09 PM:** The `dd()` statement was changed to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`, shifting the debugging focus to deceased contact data. The truncation point remained the same.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM:** The `dd()` statement was further changed to `dd($dealsBatch);`, indicating a shift in debugging focus to deal data. The truncation point remained the same.
*   **1/16/2026, 11:00:16 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was removed, suggesting the completion of debugging for data batch preparation. The file content remained truncated.

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**

This file defines the `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` class, which transforms PlotBox data into a HubSpot-compatible format.

*   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM:** The initial log entry for this file shows its core implementation. It includes a constructor that initializes HubSpot services (Owner and Location), fetches lists of owners and locations, and sets up configuration values for HubSpot lifecycle and deal stages. It also contains `usleep()` calls, likely for rate limiting. The class defines methods (`mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, `mapDeal`) to map data to CRM objects, along with helper methods for date validation, deal name generation, JSON email extraction, and field formatting/normalization (e.g., uppercasing state, standardizing pipeline/deal stage names). A `__destruct` method is also present for resource cleanup.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Intensive Debugging:** The most significant pattern is the frequent use of `dd()` (die and dump) statements in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` and hardcoded query conditions/`LIMIT 1` in `Contact.php`. This indicates an active, iterative debugging process focused on ensuring the correct data is retrieved, prepared, and transformed at various stages of the CRM synchronization flow.
*   **Dynamic vs. Hardcoded SQL:** The `Contact.php` file shows repeated switching between dynamic date-range based SQL filters and hardcoded contract numbers. This suggests testing specific scenarios and then returning to the production-ready dynamic filtering.
*   **Environment-Specific Logic:** The introduction of a conditional `CONTRACT_STATUS` filter in `Contact.php` demonstrates a pattern of implementing logic that adapts based on the deployment environment (e.g., production vs. development).
*   **Modular Architecture:** The three files work together as part of a data integration pipeline: `Contact.php` fetches raw data, `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php` transforms it, and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` orchestrates the synchronization with HubSpot, reflecting a modular service-oriented design.
*   **Consistent Timestamping:** All changes occur on January 13th and 14th, 2026, with a final set of updates on January 16th, 2026, suggesting concentrated development and debugging efforts over these few days.

## 1:33:14 AM
**File-Specific Updates and Significant Timestamps:**

1.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM:** The initial version of the `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query included a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter (`'660-1004010262'`) within its `base_contracts` CTE, with date range filters commented out.
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** The SQL query was updated to remove the hardcoded contract number filter and enable the date range filtering (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN ... OR EXISTS (...)`) on contract and contact last updated dates. Notably, `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` was temporarily removed from the final `SELECT` clause.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM - 1/13/2026, 5:00:46 PM:** A series of rapid updates occurred, primarily toggling the SQL query's `WHERE` clause in the `base_contracts` CTE. The date range filter was repeatedly commented out and replaced with specific `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filters (e.g., `'660-1004010262'`, `'Draft-4157894'`, `'Draft-4157884'`, `'623-1004011168'`). During this period, `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` was re-added (at 4:13:52 PM). This indicates focused debugging on specific contract data.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** The SQL query was reverted to use the general date range filtering, disabling the specific contract number filters.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** A `LIMIT 1` clause was temporarily appended to the main `SELECT` statement in `getDataWithDateRange`, likely for quick inspection of a single result.
    *   **1/16/2026, 11:00:07 AM:** The `LIMIT 1` debugging clause was removed.
    *   **1/16/2026, 1:39:07 PM:** A significant functional change was introduced: a `contractStatusFilter` (`AND DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS = 'Approved'`) was added, to be conditionally applied to the `base_contracts` CTE *only when the application environment is 'production'*. This enhances data quality control for production deployments.
    *   **1/16/2026, 1:44:28 PM:** The column name in the `contractStatusFilter` was corrected from `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS` to `DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS`. A `dd($isProduction);` debugging statement was temporarily added to verify the environment detection.
    *   **1/16/2026, 1:53:36 PM - 1/16/2026, 2:04:29 PM:** Further debugging included adding a `dd($results);` call to inspect the query output. There was also a brief, likely erroneous, inversion of the production check logic for `contractStatusFilter` (applying it in non-production), which was quickly corrected.
    *   **1/16/2026, 2:58:12 PM:** The `dd($results);` debugging statement was removed.

2.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM:** The initial version of the `PlotBoxHubSpotService` class was committed, including the `syncPlotBoxData` method, which contained a `dd($primaryContactBatch);` debugging call. The `processContacts` method structure for handling primary and deceased contacts and deals, along with location associations and error handling, was established.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:52:09 PM:** The debugging call was changed from `dd($primaryContactBatch);` to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`, shifting the focus of debugging.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:55 PM:** The `dd($deceasedContactBatch);` debugging call was removed.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM:** A `dd($dealsBatch);` debugging call was added, targeting the deals data.
    *   **1/16/2026, 11:00:16 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` debugging call was removed.

3.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM:** This file was initially committed, defining the `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` class. It includes methods (`mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, `mapDeal`) to transform `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` instances into HubSpot-compatible data arrays. It handles various data transformations, including date conversions to epoch milliseconds, lookup of HubSpot owner and location IDs, and standardization of fields like `pipeline` and `dealstage`. The class also features a destructor for resource cleanup. (The provided log content for this file is truncated).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Extensive Debugging:** A prominent pattern is the frequent addition, modification, and removal of `dd()` (dump and die) debugging statements across both the `Contact.php` model and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` service. This indicates an active development phase focused on validating data at various stages of retrieval and processing.
*   **Iterative SQL Query Refinement:** In `Contact.php`, the `getDataWithDateRange` SQL query underwent several iterations, moving from hardcoded filters to dynamic date range filtering, then back to specific contract numbers for testing, and finally incorporating environment-specific logic for contract status.
*   **Environment-Specific Logic:** The implementation of a conditional `CONTRACT_STATUS = 'Approved'` filter based on the application's environment (`app()->environment('production')`) is a key pattern for ensuring data quality and control in different deployment stages.
*   **Consistent Data Model and Mapping:** Despite the numerous changes to the data retrieval SQL and debugging statements, the core structure of the `PlotBox\Contact` Eloquent model and the fields being mapped in `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` remain stable, suggesting a well-defined underlying data schema.
*   **HubSpot Integration Focus:** The changes clearly show ongoing work to pull specific data from PlotBox (via Snowflake) and map it accurately for synchronization with HubSpot CRM, including handling primary contacts, deceased contacts, deals, and their associations with locations.
