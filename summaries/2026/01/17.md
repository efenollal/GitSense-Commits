# Activity Summary for 1/17/2026

## 12:33:08 AM
**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**

This file defines an Eloquent model for `Contact` in the `PlotBox` namespace, which interacts with a `Snowflake` database. It includes a `getDataWithDateRange` static method responsible for fetching comprehensive contract and contact details.

*   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM:** The SQL query within `getDataWithDateRange` was modified to use a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER IN('660-1004010262')` filter, commenting out the dynamic date range and `EXISTS` conditions, likely for specific debugging.
*   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** The SQL query was reverted to its original state, reactivating the date range and `EXISTS` conditions and removing the hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter. Notably, the `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` field was removed from the final `SELECT` list.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM:** The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter (`'660-1004010262'`) was re-introduced in the SQL query, and the `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` field was re-added to the `SELECT` statement. This indicates a cycle of debugging.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:15:07 PM - 5:00:46 PM:** The hardcoded contract number in the SQL query was repeatedly changed (`'Draft-4157894'`, `'Draft-4157884'`, `'623-1004011168'`, then back to `'660-1004010262'`), consistently indicating continued debugging efforts with various specific contract IDs.
*   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** The SQL query was again reverted to use the dynamic date range filter and `EXISTS` conditions, removing the hardcoded contract number filter.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** A `LIMIT 1` clause was added to the end of the SQL query, likely to restrict results for testing purposes.
*   **1/16/2026, 11:00:07 AM:** The `LIMIT 1` clause was removed from the SQL query.
*   **1/16/2026, 1:39:07 PM:** Introduced logic to conditionally add an `AND DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS = 'Approved'` filter to the SQL query's `base_contracts` CTE, applying it only when the application environment is 'production'. The date range conditions were enclosed in parentheses.
*   **1/16/2026, 1:44:28 PM - 2:04:29 PM:** This period shows debugging efforts related to the new production environment filter:
    *   A `dd($isProduction);` (die and dump) statement was added to inspect the environment variable.
    *   The column name for the contract status filter was changed from `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS` to `DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS`.
    *   The logic for applying the 'Approved' filter was briefly inverted (to apply when *not* in production) at 1:58 PM, then reverted to apply *only* in production at 2:04 PM, suggesting testing of the conditional logic.
    *   `dd($results);` was added to inspect query results.
*   **1/16/2026, 2:58:12 PM:** The debugging `dd()` statements were removed, signifying the conclusion of this debugging phase.

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**

This service is responsible for synchronizing PlotBox data to HubSpot CRM, handling contact, deal, and location associations.

*   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM:** A `dd($primaryContactBatch);` statement was added within the `syncPlotBoxData` method to debug the primary contact data being prepared for HubSpot. The file content was truncated at the end of the `processContacts` method.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:52:09 PM:** The `dd()` statement was changed to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`, shifting the debugging focus to deceased contact data. The truncation point remained the same.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM:** The `dd()` statement was further changed to `dd($dealsBatch);`, indicating a shift in debugging focus to deal data. The truncation point remained the same.
*   **1/16/2026, 11:00:16 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was removed, suggesting the completion of debugging for data batch preparation. The file content remained truncated.

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**

This file defines the `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` class, which transforms PlotBox data into a HubSpot-compatible format.

*   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM:** The initial log entry for this file shows its core implementation. It includes a constructor that initializes HubSpot services (Owner and Location), fetches lists of owners and locations, and sets up configuration values for HubSpot lifecycle and deal stages. It also contains `usleep()` calls, likely for rate limiting. The class defines methods (`mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, `mapDeal`) to map data to CRM objects, along with helper methods for date validation, deal name generation, JSON email extraction, and field formatting/normalization (e.g., uppercasing state, standardizing pipeline/deal stage names). A `__destruct` method is also present for resource cleanup.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Intensive Debugging:** The most significant pattern is the frequent use of `dd()` (die and dump) statements in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` and hardcoded query conditions/`LIMIT 1` in `Contact.php`. This indicates an active, iterative debugging process focused on ensuring the correct data is retrieved, prepared, and transformed at various stages of the CRM synchronization flow.
*   **Dynamic vs. Hardcoded SQL:** The `Contact.php` file shows repeated switching between dynamic date-range based SQL filters and hardcoded contract numbers. This suggests testing specific scenarios and then returning to the production-ready dynamic filtering.
*   **Environment-Specific Logic:** The introduction of a conditional `CONTRACT_STATUS` filter in `Contact.php` demonstrates a pattern of implementing logic that adapts based on the deployment environment (e.g., production vs. development).
*   **Modular Architecture:** The three files work together as part of a data integration pipeline: `Contact.php` fetches raw data, `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php` transforms it, and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` orchestrates the synchronization with HubSpot, reflecting a modular service-oriented design.
*   **Consistent Timestamping:** All changes occur on January 13th and 14th, 2026, with a final set of updates on January 16th, 2026, suggesting concentrated development and debugging efforts over these few days.

## 1:33:14 AM
**File-Specific Updates and Significant Timestamps:**

1.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM:** The initial version of the `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query included a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter (`'660-1004010262'`) within its `base_contracts` CTE, with date range filters commented out.
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** The SQL query was updated to remove the hardcoded contract number filter and enable the date range filtering (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN ... OR EXISTS (...)`) on contract and contact last updated dates. Notably, `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` was temporarily removed from the final `SELECT` clause.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM - 1/13/2026, 5:00:46 PM:** A series of rapid updates occurred, primarily toggling the SQL query's `WHERE` clause in the `base_contracts` CTE. The date range filter was repeatedly commented out and replaced with specific `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filters (e.g., `'660-1004010262'`, `'Draft-4157894'`, `'Draft-4157884'`, `'623-1004011168'`). During this period, `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` was re-added (at 4:13:52 PM). This indicates focused debugging on specific contract data.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** The SQL query was reverted to use the general date range filtering, disabling the specific contract number filters.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** A `LIMIT 1` clause was temporarily appended to the main `SELECT` statement in `getDataWithDateRange`, likely for quick inspection of a single result.
    *   **1/16/2026, 11:00:07 AM:** The `LIMIT 1` debugging clause was removed.
    *   **1/16/2026, 1:39:07 PM:** A significant functional change was introduced: a `contractStatusFilter` (`AND DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS = 'Approved'`) was added, to be conditionally applied to the `base_contracts` CTE *only when the application environment is 'production'*. This enhances data quality control for production deployments.
    *   **1/16/2026, 1:44:28 PM:** The column name in the `contractStatusFilter` was corrected from `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS` to `DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS`. A `dd($isProduction);` debugging statement was temporarily added to verify the environment detection.
    *   **1/16/2026, 1:53:36 PM - 1/16/2026, 2:04:29 PM:** Further debugging included adding a `dd($results);` call to inspect the query output. There was also a brief, likely erroneous, inversion of the production check logic for `contractStatusFilter` (applying it in non-production), which was quickly corrected.
    *   **1/16/2026, 2:58:12 PM:** The `dd($results);` debugging statement was removed.

2.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM:** The initial version of the `PlotBoxHubSpotService` class was committed, including the `syncPlotBoxData` method, which contained a `dd($primaryContactBatch);` debugging call. The `processContacts` method structure for handling primary and deceased contacts and deals, along with location associations and error handling, was established.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:52:09 PM:** The debugging call was changed from `dd($primaryContactBatch);` to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`, shifting the focus of debugging.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:55 PM:** The `dd($deceasedContactBatch);` debugging call was removed.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM:** A `dd($dealsBatch);` debugging call was added, targeting the deals data.
    *   **1/16/2026, 11:00:16 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` debugging call was removed.

3.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM:** This file was initially committed, defining the `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` class. It includes methods (`mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, `mapDeal`) to transform `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` instances into HubSpot-compatible data arrays. It handles various data transformations, including date conversions to epoch milliseconds, lookup of HubSpot owner and location IDs, and standardization of fields like `pipeline` and `dealstage`. The class also features a destructor for resource cleanup. (The provided log content for this file is truncated).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Extensive Debugging:** A prominent pattern is the frequent addition, modification, and removal of `dd()` (dump and die) debugging statements across both the `Contact.php` model and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` service. This indicates an active development phase focused on validating data at various stages of retrieval and processing.
*   **Iterative SQL Query Refinement:** In `Contact.php`, the `getDataWithDateRange` SQL query underwent several iterations, moving from hardcoded filters to dynamic date range filtering, then back to specific contract numbers for testing, and finally incorporating environment-specific logic for contract status.
*   **Environment-Specific Logic:** The implementation of a conditional `CONTRACT_STATUS = 'Approved'` filter based on the application's environment (`app()->environment('production')`) is a key pattern for ensuring data quality and control in different deployment stages.
*   **Consistent Data Model and Mapping:** Despite the numerous changes to the data retrieval SQL and debugging statements, the core structure of the `PlotBox\Contact` Eloquent model and the fields being mapped in `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` remain stable, suggesting a well-defined underlying data schema.
*   **HubSpot Integration Focus:** The changes clearly show ongoing work to pull specific data from PlotBox (via Snowflake) and map it accurately for synchronization with HubSpot CRM, including handling primary contacts, deceased contacts, deals, and their associations with locations.

## 3:33:09 AM
The code changes primarily focus on refining data extraction from a PlotBox system (likely a database via Snowflake) and its subsequent preparation and synchronization with HubSpot CRM. The logs indicate an active development and debugging phase for these processes.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Changes occurred frequently between 1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM and 1/16/2026, 2:58:12 PM.
    *   **Updates:** The `getDataWithDateRange` static method, which queries a Snowflake database, was heavily modified.
        *   Initially (1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM), the SQL query's `base_contracts` CTE used a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter, commenting out the date-range filtering.
        *   Later (1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM), the date-range filtering was re-enabled, and the hardcoded contract number was removed.
        *   This pattern of switching between hardcoded contract numbers (`'660-1004010262'`, `'Draft-4157894'`, `'Draft-4157884'`, `'623-1004011168'`) and the dynamic date-range filter was repeated several times throughout 1/13/2026, indicating focused testing on specific contracts.
        *   On 1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM, `LIMIT 1` was temporarily added to the main SQL query, likely for inspecting single results during debugging, and then removed on 1/16/2026, 11:00:07 AM.
        *   A significant update on 1/16/2026, 1:39:07 PM, introduced a conditional filter `AND DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS = 'Approved'` to the `base_contracts` CTE, which would only apply when the application is in a 'production' environment. This filter was later adjusted to `DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS = 'Approved'`.
        *   Subsequent changes (1/16/2026, between 1:44:28 PM and 2:58:12 PM) involved adding and removing `dd()` calls (`dd($isProduction);`, `dd($results);`) for debugging the environment detection and the SQL query output. The logic for applying the production filter was also temporarily inverted (e.g., `!$isProduction`) before being corrected back to apply only in production at 1/16/2026, 2:58:12 PM.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Changes occurred between 1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM and 1/16/2026, 11:00:16 AM.
    *   **Updates:** This file, responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot, primarily saw the addition and removal of `dd()` debugging statements within its `syncPlotBoxData` method.
        *   `dd($primaryContactBatch);` was added on 1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM.
        *   Changed to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);` on 1/13/2026, 4:52:09 PM.
        *   Removed on 1/13/2026, 5:29:55 PM.
        *   Re-added as `dd($dealsBatch);` on 1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM.
        *   Finally removed again on 1/16/2026, 11:00:16 AM.
        *   These `dd()` calls indicate debugging efforts to inspect the various data batches (primary contacts, deceased contacts, deals) immediately before processing.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Only one entry on 1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM.
    *   **Updates:** This file defines the mapping logic from PlotBox data to HubSpot CRM objects. It includes methods:
        *   `mapContact` for mapping primary contact details (names, email, address, phone, date of birth, etc.).
        *   `mapDeceasedContact` for mapping deceased contact details (names, birth/death dates, lifecycle stage).
        *   `mapDeal` for mapping contract/deal information (purchase price, pipeline, contract number, generated deal name, link to contract).
        *   Utility functions like `isValidDate`, `generateDealName`, `getEmailFromJson`, `formatMappedFields` (which standardizes values like location IDs, states, pipelines, and HubSpot owner IDs).
        *   The constructor initializes HubSpot service dependencies (`HubSpotOwnerService`, `HubSpotLocationService`) and fetches owner and location lists. It also includes `usleep(100000)` calls, potentially for API rate limit management or ensuring data consistency. A `__destruct` method for cleanup is also present.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Intensive Debugging:** A clear pattern of iterative debugging is evident, with frequent modifications to SQL queries (hardcoded values, `LIMIT 1`) in `Contact.php` and the repeated use of `dd()` (dump and die) statements in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`. This suggests active development and troubleshooting of data flow and transformation.
*   **SQL Query Complexity:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method in `Contact.php` consistently uses multiple CTEs (`base_contracts`, `contract_writers`, `item_counts`, `primary_contacts`, `deceased_contacts`) to aggregate diverse data points related to contracts and contacts from the `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` schema.
*   **Data Standardization and Mapping:** The `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php` consistently handles the transformation and cleaning of data fields, ensuring they conform to the expected HubSpot CRM structure, including value normalization, date conversions, and lookup-based field population.
*   **Environment-Specific Logic:** The introduction and refinement of conditional logic to apply specific filters (`DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS = 'Approved'`) only in the production environment highlights an emphasis on environment-aware behavior and data quality control.
*   **Modular HubSpot Integration:** The structure of the services (`HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`) and the mapper points to a well-defined architecture for interacting with the HubSpot API for different object types and their associations.

## 4:33:09 AM
The provided log details changes across two PHP files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, and introduces a new file `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`. These changes span from January 13, 2026, to January 16, 2026.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM to 1/16/2026, 2:04:29 PM
    *   This file primarily defines the `Contact` Eloquent model for a Snowflake database, including relationships and a static method `getDataWithDateRange` to fetch contract-related data.
    *   **Initial State (1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM):** The `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query included a hardcoded `WHERE DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER IN('660-1004010262')` clause, with the intended date range filtering commented out. It selected `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id`.
    *   **Dynamic Filtering & Column Removal (1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM):** The hardcoded contract number filter was removed, and the date range filtering condition `CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}' OR EXISTS (...)` was uncommented. The `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` column was removed from the final `SELECT` list.
    *   **Repeated Debugging with Hardcoded Contracts (1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM - 1/13/2026, 5:00:46 PM):** This period shows a pattern of reverting to hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filters (e.g., `'660-1004010262'`, `'Draft-4157894'`, `'Draft-4157884'`, `'623-1004011168'`) and commenting out the date range logic. The `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` column was re-added. This indicates active testing and debugging with specific contract records.
    *   **Return to Dynamic Filtering (1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM):** The hardcoded contract number filter was removed, and date range filtering was re-enabled.
    *   **Debugging Output Limits (1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM - 1/16/2026, 11:00:07 AM):** A `limit 1` clause was temporarily added to the SQL query for debugging purposes and later removed.
    *   **Production Environment Conditional Filtering (1/16/2026, 1:39:07 PM onwards):** A significant functional change introduced logic to apply a `AND DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS = 'Approved'` filter *only* when the application environment is 'production'. There were several immediate revisions and corrections to this logic, including adding and removing `dd()` debugging statements to inspect the `$isProduction` variable and the `$results` output (`1/16/2026, 1:44:28 PM`, `1/16/2026, 1:53:36 PM`, `1/16/2026, 1:58:05 PM`, `1/16/2026, 2:04:17 PM`). Specifically, the condition for applying the filter was briefly inverted (`!$isProduction`) before being corrected back to `$isProduction`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **Timestamp Range:** 1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM to 1/16/2026, 11:00:16 AM
    *   This service is responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot CRM.
    *   **Debugging `syncPlotBoxData` (1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM - 1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM):** The `syncPlotBoxData` method included `dd()` debugging statements at various points to inspect batch data (`$primaryContactBatch`, then `$deceasedContactBatch`, then `$dealsBatch`). These `dd()` calls were subsequently removed as debugging progressed.
    *   **Consistent Truncation:** A `Log::error` call within the `processContacts` method's location association block remains truncated throughout all recorded changes for this file.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM
    *   This file appears to be newly introduced in this log.
    *   It defines a `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` class responsible for mapping `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` to HubSpot CRM contact and deal properties.
    *   The constructor initializes HubSpot owner and location services, fetching relevant lists. It also defines configuration values for HubSpot lifecycle stages and pipelines.
    *   A destructor is included for resource cleanup (clearing arrays, unsetting services).
    *   Key mapping methods (`mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, `mapDeal`) are implemented to transform PlotBox data fields, including validation for date fields and generating a deal name.
    *   A `formatMappedFields` helper method centralizes data normalization and lookups (e.g., `loc_id`, `state`, `pipeline`, `hubspot_owner_id`, `dealstage`) to align data with HubSpot's expected formats.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Intensive Debugging:** A prominent pattern is the frequent use of `dd()` (dump and die) statements and temporary modifications to SQL queries (hardcoding contract numbers, adding/removing `LIMIT` clauses) in `Contact.php` and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`. This indicates an active development phase focused on isolating and testing specific data flows and filtering conditions.
*   **HubSpot Integration Focus:** The changes primarily revolve around the integration with HubSpot CRM, involving data retrieval (`Contact.php`), data mapping (`PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`), and data synchronization (`PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`).
*   **Data Transformation and Normalization:** The `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php` highlights a need for robust data transformation, including date format conversions, string manipulation (trimming, uppercasing), and dynamic lookups (owner IDs, location IDs) to ensure compatibility with the target CRM.
*   **Environment-Specific Logic:** The introduction of a conditional filter for 'Approved' contracts based on the application's environment (`production` vs. non-production) in `Contact.php` indicates an effort to tailor data processing for different deployment stages.
*   **Error Logging:** Both `Contact.php` and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` include `Log::info` and `Log::error` calls, suggesting a consistent approach to logging operational details and handling exceptions during the data synchronization process.
*   **Incremental Development and Refinement:** The log shows a clear iterative process of implementing features, testing them (often with direct code modifications like `dd()` or hardcoded filters), and then generalizing or refining the implementation (e.g., removing hardcoded values, adding production checks).

## 5:33:06 AM
The logs show changes across two main files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, with an initial entry for `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`.

### File-Specific Updates:

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**

*   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method initially uses a SQL query with a hardcoded filter `WHERE DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER IN('660-1004010262')`. The intended date range and `EXISTS` subquery filters are commented out.
*   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** The hardcoded contract number filter is removed, and the date range filters for `DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` and `dc.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` (within an `EXISTS` subquery) are uncommented and made active. Additionally, the `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` column is removed from the final `SELECT` statement.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM:** The date range filters are commented out again, and the hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter (`'660-1004010262'`) is re-introduced. The `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` column is also restored to the final `SELECT` list.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:15:07 PM to 1/13/2026, 5:00:46 PM:** The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter is repeatedly changed to different specific values (`'Draft-4157894'`, `'Draft-4157884'`, `'623-1004011168'`, `'660-1004010262'`). This indicates ongoing targeted testing of the SQL query with different contract data.
*   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter is removed, and the date range filters are uncommented and activated again, returning to the general date-based filtering logic.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** A `LIMIT 1` clause is added to the end of the SQL query, likely for debugging purposes to inspect a single result.
*   **1/16/2026, 11:00:07 AM:** The `LIMIT 1` clause is removed.
*   **1/16/2026, 1:39:07 PM:** A significant functional change is introduced: a conditional filter for `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS = 'Approved'` is added to the `base_contracts` CTE. This filter is applied only when the application environment is 'production'. The existing WHERE clause is also enclosed in parentheses for correct logical grouping.
*   **1/16/2026, 1:44:28 PM:** A `dd($isProduction);` statement is added for debugging the environment check. The column used for contract status filtering is changed from `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS` to `DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS`.
*   **1/16/2026, 1:45:01 PM:** The `dd($isProduction);` debugging statement is removed.
*   **1/16/2026, 1:53:36 PM:** A `dd($results);` statement is added after the SQL query execution, for debugging the query output.
*   **1/16/2026, 1:58:05 PM:** The logic for applying the `DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS = 'Approved'` filter is momentarily inverted, applying it in non-production environments instead of production. The `dd($results);` remains.
*   **1/16/2026, 2:04:17 PM:** The conditional logic for the `contractStatusFilter` is corrected back to applying in production environments. The `dd($results);` remains.
*   **1/16/2026, 2:04:29 PM:** The `dd($results);` debugging statement is removed.
*   **1/16/2026, 2:58:12 PM:** The environment check `app()->environment('production')` is refactored to be directly used in the `$contractStatusFilter` assignment, removing the intermediate `$isProduction` variable.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**

*   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM:** This file's initial commit defines a service for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot. It handles fetching data, mapping it, and then orchestrating the creation/update and association of primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals in HubSpot. It includes a `dd($primaryContactBatch);` debugging statement within `syncPlotBoxData`. Error logging is implemented for different processing stages.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:52:09 PM:** The debugging statement is changed from `dd($primaryContactBatch);` to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM:** The debugging statement is changed from `dd($deceasedContactBatch);` to `dd($dealsBatch);`.
*   **1/16/2026, 11:00:16 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` debugging statement is removed.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**

*   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM:** This file is introduced, defining a mapper class responsible for converting `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` into a format suitable for HubSpot CRM (contacts and deals). It includes logic for formatting various fields, normalizing values (e.g., state to uppercase, pipeline names), looking up HubSpot owner and location IDs, and handling date validations. A destructor is also present for resource cleanup.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** Activation of date range filtering and temporary removal of `Contract_Id` from results in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM:** Reversion to hardcoded contract filtering and restoration of `Contract_Id` in `Contact.php`. This begins a series of changes for targeted contract testing.
*   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** Re-activation of date range filtering in `Contact.php` after several debugging iterations with hardcoded contract numbers.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** Addition of `LIMIT 1` for focused result inspection in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/16/2026, 1:39:07 PM:** Introduction of environment-specific contract status filtering (`AND DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS = 'Approved'`) in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM to 1/16/2026, 11:00:16 AM:** Iterative debugging with `dd()` statements in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` as different batches of data (primary contacts, deceased contacts, deals) are being tested.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Debugging Iterations:** A strong pattern of adding and removing `dd()` (dump and die) statements at different points in the code, especially in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` and `Contact.php`, clearly indicates active development and debugging cycles. This suggests a developer is iteratively testing data processing and SQL query outputs.
*   **SQL Query Refinement:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method in `Contact.php` undergoes repeated modifications to its `WHERE` clause: toggling between a specific hardcoded contract number for testing and the general date range filter, and then introducing conditional logic for production environments. This shows a transition from development/testing to a more production-ready logic.
*   **Data Mapping and Transformation:** The `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php` highlights a common pattern in integration projects: mapping raw data (PlotBox DTOs) to a target system's format (HubSpot CRM), including data normalization and lookup of related IDs.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Both `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` and `Contact.php` include `Log::error` and `Log::info` statements, indicating a focus on observability and robustness in the data processing and syncing logic. The `processContacts` method in `PlotBoxHubSpotService` explicitly wraps steps in individual try-catch blocks to ensure resilience and partial processing even if some steps fail.
