# Activity Summary for 1/24/2026

## 3:29:32 AM
The provided log details changes across two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

**1. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
This file, representing an Eloquent Model for `Contact` in a PlotBox context, undergoes numerous changes primarily focused on its `getDataWithDateRange` static method, which queries a Snowflake data warehouse.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM (Initial State):** The `getDataWithDateRange` method contains a complex SQL query that retrieves contract and contact information, calculates total taxes, net prices, identifies contract writers, and counts various item types (caskets, cremation products, ground, markers, mausoleums, niches, OCs, merchandise, services, private estates, urns, vaults). The `WHERE` clause for `base_contracts` filters based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `dc.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within a given date range. A `contractStatusFilter` is applied conditionally for production environments.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM:** A significant change is introduced in the `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause. The original date range filtering and the `EXISTS` subquery are **commented out**, and a hardcoded filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` is added. This indicates a temporary change, likely for testing or debugging a specific contract. The `contract_tax_totals` CTE still includes a reference to `ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total` even though `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` is not fully calculated in the current snippet (it's cut off, but the reference remains). The final `SELECT` statement is also truncated.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM:** No functional change is observed in the provided snippet. The hardcoded contract number filter and the commented-out date range logic persist. The truncation of the `SELECT` statement also remains.

*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:**
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE is **commented out entirely**.
    *   Consequently, the `contract_tax_totals` CTE has its reference to `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` **commented out**. This indicates a decision to temporarily or permanently exclude cancelled contract fees from the total tax calculation.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:**
    *   A critical bug fix is applied: in the `contract_fee_tax` CTE, `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` is changed to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)`. It appears the table alias `f` was incorrectly used instead of `cf` for `TAX_AMOUNT`.
    *   Similarly, in the `deed_fee_tax` CTE, `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` is changed to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)`. This seems to be another correction, assuming `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` was intended, although `df.TAX_AMOUNT` might have been the correct original intention given the `df` alias for `DIM_DEED_FEE`. This specific change looks like a potential copy-paste error where `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` (from `contract_fee_tax`) was used instead of `df.TAX_AMOUNT`.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM:**
    *   The bug in `deed_fee_tax` is corrected: `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` is changed to `SUM(df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)`, correctly using `df.TAX_AMOUNT`.
    *   In `contract_fee_tax`, the `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` condition is changed to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` (capital 'I'), indicating a case-sensitivity adjustment.
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remains commented out.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:**
    *   The `WHERE` clauses for `cf.CONTRACT_ID` and `df.CONTRACT_ID` in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` (and implicitly for the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`) are changed to include a `CAST(...) AS INT)` for the subquery `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)`. This suggests a type casting issue or a requirement for explicit type conversion in the Snowflake query.
    *   The hardcoded contract number filter in `base_contracts` is changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM:** No functional change is observed in the provided snippet, continuing the previous change of the hardcoded contract number filter.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:28 PM:** No functional change is observed in the provided snippet.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM:** The `CAST(... AS INT)` syntax is adjusted slightly in the `WHERE` clauses for `cf.CONTRACT_ID` and `df.CONTRACT_ID`. For `deed_fee_tax`, it changes from `IN (CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT))` to `IN SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)`. This looks like a syntax error in the provided log, missing the opening parenthesis for `SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts`.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM:** The `CAST(... AS INT)` is **removed** from the `WHERE` clauses of `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax`, reverting to `IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)`. This indicates the explicit casting was either unnecessary or caused issues.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM:** In the `contract_tax_totals` CTE, `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` is **uncommented and included in the sum**, despite the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE itself remaining commented out. This introduces a potential bug where `ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total` will always be `0` or cause an error if `ccft` is not defined.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM:** In `contract_tax_totals`, the `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` part is commented out again, indicating the previous change was erroneous given that `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE is still commented out.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM:** No functional change is observed in the provided snippet.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:29:42 PM:** In `contract_tax_totals`, the `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` part is completely removed from the calculation (not just commented out), and the line now simply sums `cft.contract_fee_tax_total` and `dft.deed_fee_tax_total`. This suggests a decision to entirely exclude cancelled fees from the total tax for now.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` filter in the `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause is **commented out**, and the original date range filtering logic is **uncommented and reinstated**. This returns the query to its intended date-range-based filtering behavior.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:32:48 PM:** The final `SELECT` statement now includes all previously truncated fields (e.g., `OC_Owned`, `Other_Merchandise_Owned`, `Other_Services_Owned`, `Private_Estates_Owned`, `Urns_Owned`, `Vaults_Owned`) and adds the necessary `LEFT JOIN` clauses for `item_counts`, `contract_net_prices`, `facility_dim`, `contract_writers`, and `deceased_contacts` to the `primary_contacts` base. This completes the SQL query.

**2. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
This file handles the synchronization of PlotBox data to HubSpot CRM.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM (Initial State):** The `syncPlotBoxData` method includes a `dd($dealsBatch)` call, which is a Laravel helper for "dump and die," effectively halting execution for debugging purposes.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` line is **removed**. This suggests that the debugging step was completed, and the full synchronization logic can now proceed.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` line is **re-added**. This indicates a reversion, likely due to needing to debug the `dealsBatch` again, or possibly a mistaken revert during another change.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` line is **removed again**. This confirms that the debugging of `dealsBatch` was either temporary or completed and no longer needed for the full sync process.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM:** Final removal of `dd($dealsBatch)` from `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**

*   **Repeated SQL Query Structure:** The SQL query within `getDataWithDateRange` in `Contact.php` is consistently complex, involving multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) like `base_contracts`, `payment_schedule_totals`, `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`, `contract_tax_totals`, `contract_net_prices`, `contract_writers`, `item_counts`, `primary_contacts`, and `deceased_contacts`.
*   **Debugging Interventions:** Frequent commenting/uncommenting of the date filter in `Contact.php` to hardcode specific contract numbers, and the addition/removal of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, indicate an iterative debugging process.
*   **Incremental Refinement of SQL:** The changes to `Contact.php` show a clear pattern of refining the SQL query: initially commenting out parts for testing, then re-enabling them, fixing subtle bugs (like `TAX_AMOUNT` alias and `FEE_TYPE` case), experimenting with type casting, and eventually finalizing the query with all necessary joins and selected fields.
*   **Focus on Tax and Item Calculation:** Several CTEs (e.g., `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`, `contract_tax_totals`, `item_counts`) and their subsequent modifications highlight an ongoing effort to accurately calculate various financial and inventory-related metrics.
*   **Data Synchronization to HubSpot:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` consistently aims to synchronize PlotBox data, mapping contacts, deceased contacts, and deals to HubSpot, including associations with locations. The repeated `dd($dealsBatch)` suggests issues or verification steps around the deal mapping or processing.
