# Activity Summary for 1/16/2026

## 3:33:16 AM
The code changes primarily involve two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`. A third file, `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`, was included but showed no functional changes within the provided timestamps.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**:
    *   This file, which defines an Eloquent model for `Contact` and includes a `getDataWithDateRange` method containing a complex Snowflake SQL query, underwent frequent modifications to its SQL `WHERE` clause.
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM:** The SQL query was modified to filter by a specific contract number (`'660-1004010262'`) by uncommenting this line and commenting out the dynamic date-range filtering.
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** The SQL query was reverted to use dynamic date-range filtering, and the hardcoded contract number filter was removed. Additionally, the `Contract_Id` field was temporarily removed from the final `SELECT` statement.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM:** The SQL query reverted again to filtering by the specific contract number `'660-1004010262'`. The `Contract_Id` field was re-added to the final `SELECT` statement, correcting the previous change.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:15:07 PM, 4:23:10 PM, 4:36:52 PM, 4:49:40 PM, 5:00:46 PM:** The hardcoded contract number in the SQL query was repeatedly changed to different values (`'Draft-4157894'`, `'Draft-4157884'`, `'623-1004011168'`, then back to `'660-1004010262'`) across multiple commits, indicating focused testing on individual contract data.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** The SQL query was reverted back to the dynamic date-range filtering mechanism, removing the hardcoded contract number filter.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** A `LIMIT 1` clause was added to the end of the SQL query, likely to restrict the number of results for further testing or debugging.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**:
    *   This service is responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM:** A debugging `dd($primaryContactBatch);` statement was added within the `syncPlotBoxData` method to inspect the primary contact data.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:52:09 PM:** The debugging statement was changed to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`, shifting the focus to inspecting deceased contact data.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:55 PM:** The `dd()` statement was removed, allowing the sync process to run further.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM:** A new `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was added, indicating further debugging efforts, now targeting the deals data batch.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**:
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM:** No functional changes were observed in this log entry for the `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` class. It continues to define mapping logic for contacts (primary and deceased) and deals, including data formatting, date validation, and lookups for HubSpot owners and locations.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM:** Start of specific contract number testing in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** Reversion to dynamic date filter and a temporary structural change in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM:** Introduction of debugging `dd()` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** Final return to dynamic date filtering in `Contact.php` for the day.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM:** Continued debugging efforts, evidenced by a new `dd()` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** Addition of `LIMIT 1` to the SQL query in `Contact.php`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Debugging/Testing:** A strong pattern of iterative debugging and testing is evident. In `Contact.php`, the SQL query's `WHERE` clause was repeatedly toggled between a dynamic date range and hardcoded contract numbers, suggesting testing specific data scenarios. Similarly, in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, the use and modification of `dd()` statements (e.g., inspecting `primaryContactBatch`, then `deceasedContactBatch`, then `dealsBatch`) indicates a systematic debugging process.
*   **SQL Query Manipulation:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method in `Contact.php` was a central point of modification, with the core SQL query being frequently adjusted, commented, and uncommented.
*   **Minor Reversions:** Some changes were quickly reverted or corrected (e.g., the removal and re-addition of `Contract_Id`), suggesting a trial-and-error approach during development.
*   **Focus on Data Sync:** The changes overall point to active development and debugging related to the PlotBox data synchronization process with HubSpot CRM, particularly around how contract and contact data is queried and processed.

## 4:32:52 AM
The code changes primarily involve two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, with one entry for `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    This file, which defines the `Contact` Eloquent model for PlotBox data, underwent frequent modifications to its `getDataWithDateRange` SQL query.
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM:** The SQL query was configured to filter by a specific hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` (`'660-1004010262'`), with the date-based filtering logic commented out. This indicates an initial phase of testing with specific data.
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter was removed, and the original date-based filtering (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}' OR EXISTS (...)`) was uncommented and reactivated, suggesting a return to production-like data fetching.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM - 1/13/2026, 5:00:46 PM:** This period shows a series of rapid changes where the date-based filtering was repeatedly commented out and replaced with various hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` values. The specific contract numbers used for filtering changed multiple times:
        *   `'660-1004010262'` (reintroduced at 4:13:52 PM and 5:00:46 PM)
        *   `'Draft-4157894'` (at 4:15:07 PM and 4:23:10 PM)
        *   `'Draft-4157884'` (at 4:36:52 PM)
        *   `'623-1004011168'` (at 4:49:40 PM)
        These repeated modifications strongly suggest active debugging or focused testing on individual contracts.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter was again removed, and the date-based filtering (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}' OR EXISTS (...)`) was restored, indicating another switch back to general date-range driven data retrieval.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** A `limit 1` clause was added to the end of the main SQL query, likely for further debugging or to inspect a single record's output.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    This service class handles the synchronization of PlotBox data to HubSpot. The changes indicate active debugging of the data processing flow.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM:** A `dd($primaryContactBatch);` statement was present in the `syncPlotBoxData` method, pausing execution to inspect the mapped primary contact data.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:52:09 PM:** The `dd()` statement was modified to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`, shifting the debugging focus to the mapped deceased contact data.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM:** The `dd()` statement was further modified to `dd($dealsBatch);`, indicating a shift in debugging to inspect the mapped deal data.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM:** This entry introduces or updates the `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` class. This mapper is crucial for transforming raw PlotBox data (`PlotBoxDataTransferObject`) into a format suitable for HubSpot CRM. It includes methods to map `primaryContact` data, `deceasedContact` data (handling cases where a deceased contact might be missing), and `deal` data. Key functionalities include:
        *   Initialization with `HubSpotOwnerService` and `HubSpotLocationService` to fetch and cache owner and location lists.
        *   `__destruct` method for cleanup of cached data and services.
        *   `isValidDate` utility for robust date validation.
        *   `generateDealName` for creating standardized deal names.
        *   `formatMappedFields` which standardizes data like `loc_id`, `state`, `relationship_to_the_deceased`, `pipeline`, `hubspot_owner_id`, and `dealstage` by performing lookups and normalization.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Debugging:** A clear pattern of iterative debugging is evident, particularly in `Contact.php` with the constant toggling between date-based and hardcoded contract number filters, and in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` with the repeated modification of `dd()` statements to inspect different data batches.
*   **Data Synchronization Focus:** The changes revolve around preparing and syncing PlotBox contact and contract data to a CRM (likely HubSpot), including handling primary contacts, deceased contacts, and sales deals, along with associated locations and owners.
*   **Date Formatting and Validation:** The `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php` explicitly includes date validation and conversion to epoch milliseconds, highlighting the importance of correct date handling for CRM integration.
*   **HubSpot Integration:** The file paths and class names (`HubSpotRepositoryInterface`, `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`, `PlotBoxHubSpotService`) consistently indicate that the overarching goal of these changes is to facilitate data transfer to HubSpot.
*   **Specific Contract Number Debugging:** The repeated use of `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '...'` in `Contact.php` across multiple timestamps suggests a concentrated effort to troubleshoot or test specific contract scenarios.

## 8:33:01 AM
The changes primarily affect two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, with one appearance of `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php` indicating its structure at that point.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   This file, an Eloquent model for `Contact`, contains a significant SQL query within its `getDataWithDateRange` static method, which is the primary focus of changes.
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM:** The initial log shows the `getDataWithDateRange` SQL query with a hardcoded filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER IN('660-1004010262')` and the actual date range filtering commented out.
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** The hardcoded contract number filter is removed, and the dynamic date range filtering (based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or associated contact's `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME`) is activated. A minor change involved the removal of `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` from the final SELECT statement (though it reappears later).
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM - 1/13/2026, 5:00:46 PM:** The code repeatedly reverts to using a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter, with the contract number changing across multiple timestamps (`'660-1004010262'`, `'Draft-4157894'`, `'Draft-4157884'`, `'623-1004011168'`, and back to `'660-1004010262'`). The dynamic date filtering remains commented out during this period. The `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` field is also re-added. This suggests an intensive debugging or testing phase focused on specific contracts.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** The SQL query is reverted to its state from 3:52:26 PM, reactivating the dynamic date range filtering and removing the hardcoded contract number.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** A `LIMIT 1` clause is added to the end of the main SQL query, restricting the output to a single result.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   This service handles syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot, involving primary contacts, deceased contacts, deals, and location associations.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM:** An initial state, including a `dd($primaryContactBatch);` (dump and die) statement, suggesting a debugging halt for primary contact data. The `processContacts` method details the multi-step process for HubSpot integration.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:52:09 PM:** The `dd()` statement is changed to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`, shifting the debugging focus to deceased contact data.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:55 PM:** Both previous `dd()` statements are removed, indicating the completion of related debugging for primary and deceased contacts.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM:** A new `dd($dealsBatch);` statement is introduced, indicating a shift in debugging focus to the deals data immediately after batch preparation.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM:** This log entry shows the complete structure of a data mapper responsible for transforming `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` into HubSpot-compatible contact and deal data. It includes methods for mapping primary contacts (`mapContact`), deceased contacts (`mapDeceasedContact`), and deals (`mapDeal`), along with helper functions for date validation, deal name generation, and looking up HubSpot owners and locations. There are no iterative changes within this specific log entry, but it appears to be a stable version of the mapping logic at that time.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** `Contact.php` transitions from hardcoded SQL filtering to dynamic date-range filtering.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM - 5:00:46 PM:** `Contact.php` shows repeated modifications to its SQL query, cycling through different hardcoded contract numbers for testing purposes.
*   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** `Contact.php` reverts back to dynamic date-range filtering in its SQL query, ending the specific contract number testing phase.
*   **1/13/2026, 5:29:55 PM:** `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` removes `dd()` statements, indicating completion of earlier debugging steps.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM:** `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` introduces a new `dd($dealsBatch);` statement, starting a new debugging focus.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** `Contact.php` adds a `LIMIT 1` clause to its main SQL query, likely for testing or specific data retrieval purposes.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Debugging/Testing:** A strong pattern of inserting, changing, and removing `dd()` (dump and die) statements in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` for inspecting data at various stages of the HubSpot sync process. Similarly, `Contact.php` repeatedly toggles its SQL query between dynamic date range filtering and specific hardcoded contract numbers, suggesting focused testing of individual contracts.
*   **SQL Query Tuning:** Frequent modifications to the `getDataWithDateRange` SQL query in `Contact.php` reflect ongoing refinement of data extraction logic from the Snowflake warehouse. The query structure, involving multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) like `base_contracts`, `contract_writers`, `item_counts`, `primary_contacts`, and `deceased_contacts`, remains consistent across changes.
*   **HubSpot Integration:** The purpose of the changes revolves around syncing PlotBox data (contacts, deals, locations) to HubSpot CRM, using dedicated services and mappers.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Both `Contact.php` and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` extensively use `Log::info` and `Log::error` for tracking execution flow and capturing exceptions, demonstrating a focus on robust monitoring.
*   **Consistent Database Schema:** The SQL queries consistently refer to tables within the `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` schema.
*   **Data Transformation Logic:** The `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php` illustrates a standardized approach to mapping and formatting data fields before sending them to HubSpot, including normalization for owner IDs, locations, and pipelines.

## 9:33:04 AM
The changes primarily revolve around a data synchronization process from a PlotBox system (likely a database) to HubSpot CRM. The updates span two main files: a Laravel Eloquent model responsible for data retrieval and a service class orchestrating the HubSpot synchronization.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM**: The `getDataWithDateRange` SQL query was temporarily modified to filter `DIM_CONTRACT` by a hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` (`'660-1004010262'`), with the original date-range filtering logic commented out.
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM**: This change reverted the previous one, uncommenting the dynamic date-range filtering (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}'` and an `EXISTS` subquery for `DIM_CONTACT` updates) and removing the hardcoded contract number. It also re-added `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` to the final `SELECT` list.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM - 1/13/2026, 5:00:46 PM (multiple timestamps)**: A series of changes involved re-introducing and repeatedly modifying the hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` in the `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause, while keeping the date-range filtering commented out. The specific contract numbers tested were `'660-1004010262'`, `'Draft-4157894'`, `'Draft-4157884'`, and `'623-1004011168'`. The entry at **1/13/2026, 4:23:10 PM** showed no functional code change.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM**: The hardcoded contract number filter was removed again, and the original date-range filtering logic was uncommented and re-enabled, similar to the change at 3:52:26 PM.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM**: A `LIMIT 1` clause was added to the end of the main SQL query within `getDataWithDateRange`, likely for debugging or testing purposes to restrict the number of results.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM**: The `syncPlotBoxData` method was modified to include a `dd($primaryContactBatch);` (dump and die) statement, halting execution to inspect the primary contacts data. Sleep calls (`sleep(10)`, `sleep(5)`) were introduced within the `processContacts` method, possibly for API rate limiting or to allow HubSpot time to process data. The log content was truncated at the end of the file.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:52:09 PM**: The `dd()` statement was changed to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`, shifting the debugging focus to deceased contact data. The log content remained truncated.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:55 PM**: The `dd()` statement was removed from `syncPlotBoxData`, indicating the debugging step for contact batches might have been completed, allowing the sync process to run further. The log content remained truncated.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM**: A `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was re-introduced in `syncPlotBoxData`, redirecting debugging efforts to the deals batch. The log content remained truncated.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM**: This single entry introduces a new mapper class, `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`, which handles the transformation of PlotBox Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) into arrays suitable for HubSpot's CRM. It defines methods for mapping primary contacts (`mapContact`), deceased contacts (`mapDeceasedContact`), and deals (`mapDeal`). It includes logic for:
        *   Fetching HubSpot owners and locations.
        *   Robust date validation (`isValidDate`).
        *   Generating deal names.
        *   Standardizing various fields (e.g., `loc_id`, `state`, `pipeline`, `dealstage`, `hubspot_owner_id`) according to HubSpot's expected format and configured values.
        *   A destructor to clean up resources, logging its activity.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Iterative Debugging**: There's a clear pattern of iterative debugging, especially prominent in the `PlotBox\Contact.php` file with the repeated commenting/uncommenting of the date filter and hardcoding specific contract numbers, and in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` with the use of `dd()` to inspect different data batches (primary contacts, deceased contacts, deals). The `LIMIT 1` addition also points to focused debugging.
2.  **HubSpot Integration Focus**: The changes are highly focused on integrating PlotBox data with HubSpot CRM, involving data retrieval, mapping, and synchronization logic for contacts and deals.
3.  **Data Transformation and Normalization**: The `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` highlights a need for significant data transformation and normalization to align PlotBox data formats with HubSpot's requirements, including date conversions, case changes, and mapping specific values (like pipelines and deal stages) to configured HubSpot IDs.
4.  **Resilience in Sync Process**: The `PlotBoxHubSpotService` includes `try-catch` blocks around individual processing steps (primary contacts, deceased contacts, deals) and `sleep` calls, suggesting an effort to handle API interactions and potential failures gracefully and manage rate limits.
5.  **Consistent File Access**: The file paths indicate a consistent development environment (`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\`).
6.  **Truncated Log Entries**: The log for `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` consistently ends abruptly, likely due to a limit in the log collection mechanism.

## 10:33:09 AM
The development log primarily details changes within two PHP files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, with one entry for `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`. These changes indicate active development and debugging of a data synchronization process from a PlotBox system to HubSpot CRM.

**File-Specific Updates and Timestamps:**

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
This Eloquent model is responsible for fetching contact and contract data from a Snowflake database.

*   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM:** Initial state. The `getDataWithDateRange` method contains a complex SQL query to retrieve contract, contact, and item count data. Importantly, the primary `WHERE` clause for `base_contracts` is temporarily hardcoded to `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER IN('660-1004010262')`, with the intended date range filtering commented out.
*   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** The hardcoded contract number filter is removed, and the date range filtering (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}' OR EXISTS (...)`) is uncommented, enabling dynamic date-based data retrieval.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM - 1/13/2026, 5:00:46 PM (multiple entries):** The `WHERE` clause in the `base_contracts` CTE is repeatedly modified. The dynamic date range filter is commented out, and different hardcoded contract numbers are inserted and changed (`'660-1004010262'`, `'Draft-4157894'`, `'Draft-4157884'`, `'623-1004011168'`, and back to `'660-1004010262'`). This pattern strongly suggests iterative testing with specific sample contract data.
*   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** The date range filtering logic in the `WHERE` clause is restored (uncommented), and the hardcoded contract number condition is removed, reverting to the dynamic filtering functionality.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** A `LIMIT 1` clause is added to the end of the main SQL `SELECT` statement in `getDataWithDateRange`. This is a significant change, restricting the query to return only a single result, likely for focused debugging or inspection of a specific record.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
This service orchestrates the synchronization of PlotBox data to HubSpot.

*   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM:** The `syncPlotBoxData` method includes a `dd($primaryContactBatch);` statement immediately after batching primary, deceased, and deal data. This "dump and die" command indicates an active debugging session, stopping execution to inspect the contents of `$primaryContactBatch`. The `processContacts` method is outlined, demonstrating logic for searching, creating, updating contacts and deals, and associating them with locations, including `sleep` calls for HubSpot processing.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:52:09 PM:** The debugging focus shifts, as the `dd($primaryContactBatch);` call is changed to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`, indicating inspection of the deceased contacts batch.
*   **1/13/2026, 5:29:55 PM:** The `dd()` statement is removed from `syncPlotBoxData`, suggesting that the batch inspection for contacts is complete, and the code is intended to proceed with `processContacts`.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM:** A `dd($dealsBatch);` call is re-introduced into `syncPlotBoxData`, now focusing debugging efforts on the deals data.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
This mapper class translates PlotBox data transfer objects into a format suitable for HubSpot.

*   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM:** This entry shows the full implementation of the `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` class. It maps primary contacts (`mapContact`), deceased contacts (`mapDeceasedContact`), and deals (`mapDeal`). Key features include:
    *   Initialization with `HubSpotOwnerService` and `HubSpotLocationService`.
    *   `usleep(100000)` calls in the constructor, possibly for rate limiting or ensuring data readiness.
    *   A `__destruct` method for explicit resource cleanup (clearing arrays and unsetting services).
    *   Extensive formatting and lookup logic in `formatMappedFields` for standardizing data (e.g., uppercasing state, normalizing pipeline and deal stage names, looking up owner IDs by email and location IDs by code).
    *   Helper functions like `isValidDate` and `generateDealName`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Iterative Debugging:** The most prominent pattern is the repeated addition, modification, and removal of `dd()` statements in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` and the frequent toggling and specific value changes in the SQL `WHERE` clause in `PlotBox\Contact.php`. This indicates a methodical, step-by-step debugging approach, focusing on different data subsets (primary contacts, deceased contacts, deals) and specific data points (individual contract numbers) during development.
2.  **HubSpot Data Synchronization:** The changes revolve around a core task: extracting data from PlotBox's Snowflake warehouse, mapping it to HubSpot's schema, and pushing it to the CRM. This involves distinct layers for data retrieval (Model), data transformation (Mapper), and synchronization orchestration (Service).
3.  **Raw SQL for Complex Queries:** The `Contact` model uses raw SQL for its primary data retrieval method, `getDataWithDateRange`, suggesting the complexity of the joins and aggregations required was beyond standard Eloquent ORM capabilities, or it was optimized for Snowflake.
4.  **Resilience and Rate Limiting:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService` incorporates `try-catch` blocks around contact and deal processing steps for resilience against individual failures, and `sleep` calls, likely to manage HubSpot API rate limits or allow for data propagation within HubSpot. Similarly, `usleep` calls appear in the `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` constructor.
5.  **Data Normalization and Lookups:** The `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` consistently applies normalization (e.g., `strtoupper` for state, `strtolower` and `str_replace` for pipeline/dealstage) and uses service lookups (for HubSpot owners and locations) to ensure data consistency and accuracy before sending it to HubSpot.

## 11:33:03 AM
The log details changes across two primary files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, with one entry for `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**: This file, representing an Eloquent model for contacts in the PlotBox system, underwent frequent modifications to its `getDataWithDateRange` static method. This method executes a complex Snowflake SQL query to retrieve comprehensive contract and contact details.
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM:** The initial query used a hardcoded contract number filter (`DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER IN('660-1004010262')`), with the intended date range filters commented out.
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** The hardcoded contract filter was removed, and the date range filters (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}' OR EXISTS (...)`) were activated, allowing dynamic date-based data retrieval.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM to 5:00:46 PM:** A series of rapid changes occurred where the date range filters were commented out again, and the query was modified to test various specific hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` values ('660-1004010262', 'Draft-4157894', 'Draft-4157884', '623-1004011168'). This indicates a concentrated period of debugging or testing with specific contract data.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** The date range filters were re-enabled, and the specific contract number filter was removed, reverting the query to its dynamic date-filtering state.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** A `LIMIT 1` clause was temporarily added to the end of the SQL query, likely for focused debugging or to test with a minimal dataset.
    *   **1/16/2026, 11:00:07 AM:** The `LIMIT 1` clause was removed, returning the query to its full date-filtered state.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**: This service orchestrates the synchronization of PlotBox data to HubSpot CRM.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM:** A `dd($primaryContactBatch);` debugging statement was present within the `syncPlotBoxData` method, indicating an inspection of the primary contacts data before further processing.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:55 PM:** The `dd()` statement was modified to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`, shifting the focus of debugging to deceased contact data.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM:** The `dd()` statement was again modified to `dd($dealsBatch);`, moving the debugging focus to deal data.
    *   **1/16/2026, 11:00:16 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was removed, suggesting the completion of a debugging phase for data batches.
    *   A recurring pattern observed in the logs for this file is that the code content is consistently truncated towards the end, specifically within the `catch` block of the `associateDealToLocation` operation.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**: This file contains the logic for mapping data from PlotBox Data Transfer Objects to HubSpot CRM properties.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM:** This entry captures the definition of the `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` class. It includes methods (`mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, `mapDeal`) for transforming PlotBox entities into arrays suitable for HubSpot. It also features helper functions like `isValidDate`, `generateDealName`, `getEmailFromJson`, `formatMappedFields`, `getOwnersList`, `findOwnerIdByEmail`, and `getLocationIdByCode`. The mapper normalizes various fields (e.g., state to uppercase, pipeline names, owner/location lookups) and includes a destructor for resource cleanup.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM and 5:29:30 PM:** Key moments where the `Contact.php` model's `getDataWithDateRange` method toggled between specific contract filtering and a more general date-range filtering approach.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM - 1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM:** Active debugging period for the `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` indicated by changes to `dd()` statements.
*   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM:** This timestamp marks the most recent state or introduction of the `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php` file, which is crucial for the data transformation.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** Brief introduction of a `LIMIT 1` clause in the SQL query for `Contact.php`, likely for testing specific scenarios.
*   **1/16/2026, 11:00:07 AM and 11:00:16 AM:** Cleanup operations in both `Contact.php` (removing `LIMIT 1`) and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` (removing `dd()` statements), suggesting the completion of a testing/debugging phase and readiness for broader data processing.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Debugging:** A clear pattern of iterative debugging is evident, particularly in `Contact.php` with the repeated toggling of SQL `WHERE` clauses (from specific contract numbers to date ranges and back), and in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` with the progression of `dd()` debugging statements across different data batches.
*   **HubSpot Integration Focus:** The changes strongly indicate development and refinement of a system to integrate PlotBox data with HubSpot CRM, involving the extraction, mapping, and synchronization of contacts, deals, and location associations.
*   **Complex SQL Querying:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method in `Contact.php` consistently employs a multi-CTE SQL query, demonstrating a need to aggregate detailed information from several `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` tables (DIM_CONTRACT, DIM_CONTACT_OWNER, DIM_CONTACT, DIM_CONTRACT_WRITER, DIM_SYSTEM_USER, DIM_CONTRACT_ITEM, DIM_FEE, DIM_FEE_CATEGORY, DIM_FACILITY).
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` utilizes `try-catch` blocks and `Log::error` extensively, designed to handle exceptions gracefully during the data synchronization process and ensure resilience, allowing processing to continue even if individual operations fail.
*   **API Management:** The `sleep()` calls in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` suggest a proactive approach to managing API rate limits or ensuring data consistency within HubSpot by introducing delays between successive operations.

## 1:33:08 PM
The code changes primarily involve two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, with one entry for `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`. These changes indicate an active development and debugging phase related to syncing PlotBox data to a CRM system, likely HubSpot, using a Snowflake data warehouse.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   This file defines an Eloquent model for `Contact`, interacting with a Snowflake database (`PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT`).
    *   Its core function `getDataWithDateRange` executes a complex SQL query to retrieve comprehensive contract and contact data, including primary and deceased contacts, contract writers, and detailed item counts (e.g., caskets, cremations, ground, markers, mausoleum, niche, opening/closing, merchandise, services, private estates, urns, vaults).
    *   **Timestamp: 1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM**: The SQL query's `base_contracts` Common Table Expression (CTE) was initially configured with a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER IN('660-1004010262')` filter, with the date-range filtering logic commented out. This suggests an initial phase of testing with specific contract data.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM**: The hardcoded contract number filter was removed, and the date-range filtering (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}'` and an `EXISTS` subquery for contact update dates) was uncommented and activated. This shows a shift towards enabling dynamic date filtering.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM to 1/13/2026, 5:00:46 PM**: The date-range filtering was repeatedly commented out and replaced with various hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` values (e.g., `'660-1004010262'`, `'Draft-4157894'`, `'Draft-4157884'`, `'623-1004011168'`). This pattern strongly indicates an iterative debugging process, testing the query with different specific contracts.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM**: The hardcoded contract number filter was removed, and the date-range filtering was re-enabled, reverting to the state seen earlier. This suggests the specific contract testing phase concluded, and the query returned to its intended dynamic date-range operation.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM**: A `limit 1` clause was added to the end of the main SQL `SELECT` statement. This is a common debugging technique to quickly inspect the structure of a single result without fetching an entire dataset.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/16/2026, 11:00:07 AM**: The `limit 1` clause was removed, indicating the completion of the single-record debugging phase and a return to fetching all relevant data.

2.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   This file defines a service responsible for syncing PlotBox data (from Microsoft Fabric/Synapse) to HubSpot. It orchestrates the mapping of data and interaction with HubSpot API services for contacts, deals, and locations.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM**: A `dd($primaryContactBatch);` statement was added within the `syncPlotBoxData` method, indicating debugging efforts focused on the batch of primary contacts before further processing. The code for the `processContacts` method appears truncated in the log.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/13/2026, 4:52:09 PM**: The `dd()` statement was changed to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`, shifting the debugging focus to the batch of deceased contacts.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/13/2026, 5:29:55 PM**: Both previous `dd()` statements were removed.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM**: A `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was added, focusing debugging efforts on the batch of deals.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/16/2026, 11:00:16 AM**: The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was removed. All `dd()` debugging calls were eliminated, suggesting the completion of this debugging cycle. The `processContacts` method consistently appears truncated in all log entries for this file.

3.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM**: This file, shown in a single entry, defines `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`. It's crucial for transforming raw PlotBox data into a format suitable for HubSpot contacts and deals.
    *   It contains methods (`mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, `mapDeal`) to map data fields, handle date validation, generate deal names, and format mapped fields.
    *   The `formatMappedFields` method performs significant data normalization, including converting location codes to IDs, uppercasing states, standardizing relationship text, normalizing pipeline and deal stage names (e.g., 'at-need' or 'pre-need'), looking up HubSpot owner IDs by email, and sanitizing URLs for contract links.
    *   It utilizes `HubSpotOwnerService` and `HubSpotLocationService` to fetch and cache lists of owners and locations for efficient lookups.
    *   A destructor is implemented to explicitly clear resources upon object destruction.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Debugging**: A strong pattern of incremental debugging is evident, particularly in `Contact.php` (toggling date filters and specific contract numbers, adding/removing `LIMIT 1`) and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` (moving `dd()` statements to inspect different data batches).
*   **HubSpot CRM Integration**: The changes are highly focused on preparing and syncing data to HubSpot, involving detailed mapping for contacts (primary and deceased), deals, and their associations with locations and owners.
*   **Snowflake Data Source**: The `Contact` model consistently connects to a "snowflake" database and queries tables within `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS`, highlighting the data source for the CRM sync.
*   **Data Transformation Logic**: The `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` demonstrates robust data transformation, validation, and normalization to ensure data integrity and compatibility with HubSpot's schema.
*   **Error Handling and Logging**: Both the `Contact` model and the `PlotBoxHubSpotService` include `Log::info` and `Log::error` statements, indicating an emphasis on observability and error resilience within the data synchronization process.
*   **Consistent File Structure**: The core structure and purpose of the `Contact` model and `PlotBoxHubSpotService` remain consistent throughout the logs, with changes confined to refining the data retrieval SQL query and debugging flow.
*   **Partial Log Entries**: Several entries for `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` appear truncated, particularly at the end of the `processContacts` method, which might be an artifact of the log generation process rather than incomplete code commits.

## 2:33:10 PM
The code change log details a series of modifications across three PHP files within a `datalink` project, predominantly focusing on data retrieval and integration with HubSpot CRM for "PlotBox" related entities.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**: This file, representing an Eloquent model for contacts, underwent numerous revisions centered on its `getDataWithDateRange` method's Snowflake SQL query.
    *   **1/13/2026 (3:37:33 PM - 5:29:30 PM)**: The `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause was frequently toggled between a dynamic date range filter (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}' OR EXISTS (...)`) and various hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` values (e.g., `'660-1004010262'`, `'Draft-4157894'`, `'Draft-4157884'`, `'623-1004011168'`). This suggests intensive testing with specific contract data. A minor, temporary removal and re-addition of `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` from the final `SELECT` list also occurred.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM**: A `LIMIT 1` clause was added to the end of the main SQL query, then removed on **1/16/2026, 11:00:07 AM**, likely for debugging performance or initial result inspection.
    *   **1/16/2026 (1:39:07 PM - 2:04:29 PM)**: Logic was introduced to conditionally add a `CONTRACT_STATUS = 'Approved'` filter within the `base_contracts` CTE. This filter was intended to apply only in the production environment. There were several iterations:
        *   The field name initially used `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS`, then corrected to `DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS`.
        *   A temporary inversion of the production check (`!$isProduction`) occurred, which was later reverted to the correct production-only check (`$isProduction`).
        *   Multiple `dd()` debugging statements (`dd($isProduction);`, `dd($results);`) were added and subsequently removed or retained for brief periods.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**: This service, responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot, saw temporary debugging additions.
    *   **1/13/2026 (4:15:17 PM - 1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM)**: `dd()` statements were inserted within the `syncPlotBoxData` method to inspect different data batches (`$primaryContactBatch`, `$deceasedContactBatch`, `$dealsBatch`).
    *   **1/16/2026, 11:00:16 AM**: All `dd()` debugging statements were removed from this file.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**: This mapper file, first appearing in the log at **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM**, defines how `PlotBoxDataTransferObject`s are transformed into HubSpot-compatible arrays for contacts and deals.
    *   It initializes `HubSpotOwnerService` and `HubSpotLocationService`, fetches lists of owners and locations, and sets various HubSpot configuration constants (lifecycle stages, deal stages, pipelines).
    *   It provides `mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, and `mapDeal` methods to handle the specific mapping logic for each entity, including data formatting, validation (`isValidDate`), and deal name generation.
    *   A destructor `__destruct()` is implemented to clean up resources by clearing arrays and unsetting service objects.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative SQL Query Refinement**: The `Contact.php` file demonstrates a clear pattern of continuous refinement and testing of a complex SQL query. This includes frequent changes to the `WHERE` clause (switching between test contract IDs and date filters), and adding/removing `LIMIT` clauses.
*   **Aggressive Debugging**: The repeated insertion and removal of `dd()` (dump and die) statements across both `Contact.php` and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` highlights an iterative and hands-on debugging methodology during development.
*   **HubSpot Integration Focus**: All changes are consistently related to integrating PlotBox data with HubSpot CRM, involving data retrieval (`Contact.php`), data mapping (`PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`), and the synchronization process itself (`PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`).
*   **Environment-Specific Logic**: The introduction of production-specific filtering for contract status in `Contact.php` indicates an evolving approach to handling data differently based on deployment environments.

## 4:33:07 PM
The code changes primarily involve two PHP files related to a data synchronization process from a PlotBox system to HubSpot CRM, along with one mapper file. The modifications largely focus on refining data querying, debugging, and environment-specific logic.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**:
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM**: The `getDataWithDateRange` method initially used a hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` (`'660-1004010262'`) in its SQL query, with date-range filters commented out.
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM**: The hardcoded contract filter was removed, and the date-range filters (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}'` and an `EXISTS` subquery with `CAST(dc.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}'`) were uncommented, enabling dynamic filtering. A minor, short-lived change also removed `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` from the final SELECT statement.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM - 1/13/2026, 5:00:46 PM**: The code repeatedly reverted to using hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filters for testing purposes. Different contract numbers were used in these intermediate steps, such as `'660-1004010262'`, `'Draft-4157894'`, `'Draft-4157884'`, and `'623-1004011168'`. The `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` field was restored during these reversions.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM**: The query was updated again to use dynamic date-range filtering, making the date conditions active and enclosing them in parentheses for proper logical grouping.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM**: A `LIMIT 1` clause was temporarily added to the SQL query, likely for debugging, to restrict results to a single record.
    *   **1/16/2026, 11:00:07 AM**: The `LIMIT 1` clause was removed.
    *   **1/16/2026, 1:39:07 PM**: Significant logic for environment-specific filtering was introduced. A `$contractStatusFilter` variable was added, applying `AND DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS = 'Approved'` to the `base_contracts` CTE only when the application environment is 'production'.
    *   **1/16/2026, 1:44:28 PM - 1/16/2026, 2:04:29 PM**: Several small debugging and correction steps were observed:
        *   `dd($isProduction);` was temporarily added for inspecting the environment variable.
        *   The column name in the production filter was corrected from `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS` to `DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS`.
        *   Briefly, the production filter logic was inverted (applying "Approved" status *unless* in production), but this was quickly reverted to apply *only* in production.
        *   `dd($results);` was added to inspect query results.
    *   **1/16/2026, 2:58:12 PM**: All `dd()` debug statements were removed, leaving the environment-dependent `DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS = 'Approved'` filter in place for production.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**:
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM**: The `syncPlotBoxData` method was logged with a `dd($primaryContactBatch);` statement, indicating debugging of the primary contact data batch. The `processContacts` method also contained an incomplete `Log::error` message.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:52:09 PM**: The `dd()` statement was changed to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`, shifting the focus of debugging.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:55 PM**: The `dd()` statement was removed, allowing the `syncPlotBoxData` method to proceed without interruption.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM**: The `dd()` statement was changed to `dd($dealsBatch);`, further debugging different data batches.
    *   **1/16/2026, 11:00:16 AM**: The `dd()` statement was removed.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**:
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM**: This file appears as a single, comprehensive entry. It defines a `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` class responsible for transforming PlotBox data into a HubSpot-compatible format for contacts and deals. Key functionalities include:
        *   `mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, `mapDeal` methods for detailed data mapping.
        *   Helper functions like `isValidDate`, `generateDealName`, `getEmailFromJson`, `formatMappedFields` for data validation, transformation, and lookup (e.g., getting HubSpot owner IDs by email, location IDs by code, standardizing pipeline/deal stage names).
        *   Initialization of `HubSpotOwnerService` and `HubSpotLocationService` in the constructor.
        *   Configuration values for HubSpot lifecycle stages, pipelines, and deal stages are loaded.
        *   Includes `usleep(100000);` calls after fetching data from HubSpot, likely for API rate limiting or to allow external system updates.
        *   A `__destruct()` method is implemented for explicit resource cleanup.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative SQL Query Debugging**: In `app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`, there's a strong pattern of repeatedly modifying and reverting the SQL `WHERE` clause in `getDataWithDateRange` (between hardcoded contract numbers and dynamic date ranges) and adding/removing `LIMIT 1`, indicating extensive testing and debugging of the data retrieval logic.
*   **Debugging with `dd()`**: Both `app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` frequently use `dd()` (dump and die) statements at different points to inspect variables and control flow during development. These are typically removed once debugging is complete for a specific section.
*   **HubSpot Data Synchronization**: The overall context revolves around syncing data (contacts and deals) from PlotBox to HubSpot. The `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` centralizes the logic for preparing this data, while `PlotBoxHubSpotService` orchestrates the sync process, including searching, creating/updating, and associating entities in HubSpot.
*   **Environmental Logic**: A pattern emerged in `app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` to apply specific filters (e.g., `DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS = 'Approved'`) only when the application is running in a 'production' environment, ensuring different behaviors for development/testing versus live systems.
*   **Incomplete Logging**: The `Log::error` message at the end of the `processContacts` method in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` remains incomplete across multiple changes, suggesting it might be an oversight or a lower-priority task to fix.

## 6:33:06 PM
The recent code changes primarily focus on the data synchronization process from a PlotBox data source to HubSpot CRM, with significant development and debugging occurring in the SQL query logic and the HubSpot integration service.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM:** The `getDataWithDateRange` SQL query initially contained a hardcoded contract number filter (`DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER IN('660-1004010262')`) while the date range filtering logic was commented out. A `Log::info` statement was present to output the first query result.
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** The hardcoded contract number filter was removed, and the date range filtering logic (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}' OR EXISTS (...)`) was uncommented, activating the intended date-based filtering.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM - 1/13/2026, 5:00:46 PM (multiple changes):** During this period, the date range filter was repeatedly commented out, and a specific contract number filter (`DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '...'`) was re-introduced and changed several times (e.g., `'660-1004010262'`, `'Draft-4157894'`, `'Draft-4157884'`, `'623-1004011168'`), indicating intensive testing with individual contract IDs.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** The date range filtering logic was uncommented again, restoring the general date-based data retrieval mechanism.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** A `LIMIT 1` clause was temporarily added to the main `SELECT` statement, likely for debugging to quickly inspect a single record.
    *   **1/16/2026, 11:00:07 AM:** The `LIMIT 1` clause was removed.
    *   **1/16/2026, 1:39:07 PM:** Significant functional change: Logic was introduced to dynamically apply an `AND DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS = 'Approved'` filter within the `base_contracts` CTE, but only when the application environment is 'production'. The existing date range logic was also wrapped in parentheses.
    *   **1/16/2026, 1:44:28 PM:** A `dd($isProduction);` debugging statement was added, and the contract status filter column was changed from `CONTRACT_STATUS` to `STATUS` (`DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS = 'Approved'`).
    *   **1/16/2026, 2:04:17 PM:** The conditional logic for the `$contractStatusFilter` was temporarily inverted (applying in non-production environments), and a `dd($results);` debugging statement was introduced.
    *   **1/16/2026, 2:04:29 PM:** The conditional logic for the `$contractStatusFilter` was corrected back to apply only in the 'production' environment. The `dd($results);` statement remained.
    *   **1/16/2026, 2:58:12 PM:** The `dd($results);` debugging statement was removed.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM:** This file defines a service for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot. It initially included a `dd($primaryContactBatch);` debugging statement in the `syncPlotBoxData` method, halting execution after mapping primary contacts.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:52:09 PM:** The `dd()` statement was moved to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`, shifting the debugging focus to deceased contact data.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM:** The `dd()` statement was again moved to `dd($dealsBatch);`, indicating a focus on debugging deal data mapping.
    *   **1/16/2026, 11:00:16 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` debugging statement was removed.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM:** This file was introduced, defining a mapper class responsible for transforming PlotBox data into a format suitable for HubSpot CRM. Key elements include:
        *   Constants for relationship types and contract links.
        *   Constructor logic to initialize HubSpot services (Owner, Location) and fetch relevant lists (owners, locations). It also includes `usleep(100000)` calls, likely for API rate limiting or synchronization.
        *   A `__destruct()` method for resource cleanup.
        *   `mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, and `mapDeal` methods for detailed data mapping, including specific property handling for primary contacts, deceased contacts, and sales deals.
        *   Utility functions like `isValidDate` for date validation, `generateDealName` for creating deal names, `getEmailFromJson` for parsing contact JSON, and `formatMappedFields` for standardizing various CRM fields (e.g., location ID lookup, state uppercasing, pipeline normalization, HubSpot owner ID lookup).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Intensive Debugging:** A clear pattern of iterative debugging is evident, particularly on **January 13th, 2026**, and intermittently on **January 16th, 2026**, shown by the frequent addition, movement, and removal of `dd()` (dump and die) statements in both the `Contact.php` model and the `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`. This suggests a careful, step-by-step verification of data extraction and mapping.
*   **SQL Query Iteration:** The `getDataWithDateRange` SQL query in `Contact.php` underwent repeated modifications, frequently switching between hardcoded contract IDs (for isolated testing) and the dynamic date range filtering (for production-like behavior). This back-and-forth pattern points to a development cycle involving focused testing of specific data points followed by integration testing.
*   **Environment-Specific Logic:** A significant recurring theme is the introduction and refinement of environment-specific behavior, particularly applying an "Approved" contract status filter only in the `production` environment, highlighting a robust approach to data quality and deployment. There were minor corrections to this logic, including column name changes and temporary inversions, reflecting the iterative development process.
*   **HubSpot Integration Development:** The creation of `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php` and its integration within `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` indicates active development on data transformation and association logic for HubSpot CRM, involving complex mapping of various data fields and object types.
*   **API Management:** The use of `usleep` calls in the `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` constructor suggests consideration for API rate limits or ensuring data consistency across external systems.
*   **Logging:** Consistent use of `Log::info` and `Log::error` in both model and service files demonstrates a commitment to monitoring and error handling within the data synchronization process.

## 7:32:52 PM
The provided log details changes across two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, occurring between January 13, 2026, and January 16, 2026.

### File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`

This file, which defines a Laravel Eloquent model for 'Contact' data sourced from a Snowflake warehouse, underwent frequent modifications, primarily affecting the `getDataWithDateRange` static method.

*   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM:** The initial entry shows a SQL query within `getDataWithDateRange` that includes a commented-out section for filtering by `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` and `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within a date range. Instead, it explicitly filters `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` for a specific value: `'660-1004010262'`.
*   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** The SQL query in `getDataWithDateRange` was updated to *uncomment* and re-enable the date range filtering logic based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` for `DIM_CONTRACT` and `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` for `DIM_CONTACT` (via `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER` join). The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter was removed.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM:** The date range filtering in the SQL query was commented out again, and the hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER IN('660-1004010262')` was re-introduced.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:15:07 PM:** The hardcoded contract number in the SQL query was changed from `'660-1004010262'` to `'Draft-4157894'`.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:23:10 PM:** No functional change to the code, likely a re-save or minor formatting adjustment. The hardcoded contract number remains `'Draft-4157894'`.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:36:52 PM:** The hardcoded contract number in the SQL query was changed again, this time to `'Draft-4157884'`.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:49:40 PM:** The hardcoded contract number in the SQL query was changed to `'623-1004011168'`.
*   **1/13/2026, 5:00:46 PM:** The hardcoded contract number in the SQL query was reverted back to `'660-1004010262'`.
*   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** The SQL query was updated to re-enable the date range filtering based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` for `DIM_CONTRACT` and `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` for `DIM_CONTACT`, similar to the change at 3:52 PM, meaning the hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter was removed.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** A `LIMIT 1` clause was temporarily added to the end of the main SQL `SELECT` statement within `getDataWithDateRange`. This was likely for testing purposes to fetch only a single result.
*   **1/16/2026, 11:00:07 AM:** The `LIMIT 1` clause was removed from the SQL query, restoring the full result set behavior.
*   **1/16/2026, 1:39:07 PM:** Significant update: A new `isProduction` variable was introduced to conditionally add a `CONTRACT_STATUS = 'Approved'` filter to the `base_contracts` CTE. This filter applies *only* when the application environment is 'production'. The variable `contractStatusFilter` is set based on `app()->environment('production')`.
*   **1/16/2026, 1:44:28 PM - 1/16/2026, 2:12:54 PM:** Multiple small changes occurred around this time:
    *   **1:44:28 PM, 1:44:33 PM, 2:04:17 PM, 2:04:29 PM:** These entries show `dd($isProduction);` (dump and die) being added right after the `isProduction` check, indicating debugging efforts. Additionally, the condition for `contractStatusFilter` was temporarily inverted at `1:58:05 PM` (`!$isProduction`) before being corrected back to `$isProduction` at `2:04:17 PM`.
    *   **1:53:36 PM, 1:58:05 PM, 2:04:17 PM, 2:04:29 PM:** These entries show `dd($results);` being added at the end of the `getDataWithDateRange` method, suggesting further debugging of the query results.
*   **1/16/2026, 2:58:12 PM:** All `dd()` calls were removed, finalizing the conditional `contractStatusFilter` to apply in production only.

### File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`

This file, responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot, saw minor changes related to debugging.

*   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM:** A `dd($primaryContactBatch);` (dump and die) call was added within the `syncPlotBoxData` method, after populating the contact and deal batches. This indicates a debugging step to inspect the `primaryContactBatch` array.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:52:09 PM:** The `dd()` call was changed from `$primaryContactBatch` to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`, shifting the focus of debugging to the deceased contact data.
*   **1/13/2026, 5:29:55 PM:** The `dd($deceasedContactBatch);` call was removed, suggesting the immediate debugging step was completed.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM:** A `dd($dealsBatch);` call was added in the `syncPlotBoxData` method, indicating a new debugging focus on the generated deals batch.
*   **1/16/2026, 11:00:16 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` call was removed.

### File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`

This file handles mapping PlotBox data to CRM-compatible formats.

*   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM:** The key change in this file is the addition of `usleep(100000);` after initializing `ownersList` and `allLocations` in the constructor. This introduces a 100-millisecond delay after fetching these lists, likely to mitigate rate limiting or ensure data consistency with HubSpot's API during rapid initialization or subsequent calls.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Debugging focus:** There's a clear pattern of adding and removing `dd()` (dump and die) statements in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` and `Contact.php` to inspect batch data (`primaryContactBatch`, `deceasedContactBatch`, `dealsBatch`) or environment variables (`$isProduction`, `$results`), indicating an active development/debugging cycle, particularly on January 13th and 14th, and again on January 16th.
*   **Conditional SQL filtering:** In `Contact.php`, the `getDataWithDateRange` method frequently toggled between using a hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter and a date range filter. This suggests testing different data retrieval scenarios. Ultimately, a new conditional logic was implemented to apply a `CONTRACT_STATUS = 'Approved'` filter *only* in the production environment, which is a significant functional change for data filtering.
*   **Snowflake connection and PlotBox data:** Both `Contact.php` and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` consistently interact with a 'snowflake' database connection and process 'PlotBox' related data, hinting at an ETL or data synchronization process between PlotBox data (stored in Snowflake) and HubSpot CRM.
*   **HubSpot integration:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` is central to syncing data to HubSpot, involving contact, deal, and location services. The changes here show the iteration of debugging the data batches before they are sent to HubSpot.
*   **Timestamp pattern:** Changes are clustered on specific days (Jan 13th and Jan 16th, 2026), often with rapid successive modifications to the same file, reinforcing the idea of active development and debugging sessions.

## 8:33:03 PM
The changes log details updates across two primary files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, with one entry for `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**: This file, responsible for the `Contact` Eloquent model and its data retrieval logic, saw numerous iterations primarily within the `getDataWithDateRange` static method.
    *   **SQL Query Filtering**: There was a repeated pattern of toggling between a specific hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter (e.g., `'660-1004010262'`, `'Draft-4157894'`, `'Draft-4157884'`, `'623-1004011168'`) and a date range filter (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}' OR EXISTS (...)`). The hardcoded filters were used multiple times on January 13, 2026, often followed by a reversion to the date range filtering, suggesting an extensive debugging or testing process using specific contract IDs.
    *   **Query Optimization/Testing**: A `LIMIT 1` clause was temporarily added to the main SQL query on 1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM, and then removed on 1/16/2026, 11:00:07 AM, indicating testing for single record retrieval.
    *   **Production Environment Logic**: On 1/16/2026, 1:39:07 PM, a significant change introduced a conditional `contractStatusFilter` to the `base_contracts` CTE, applying `AND DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS = 'Approved'` only when `app()->environment('production')` is true. This filter was later adjusted to `DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS` and its application logic was temporarily inverted (`!$isProduction`) before being reverted to the production-only application on 1/16/2026, 2:04:29 PM.
    *   **Debugging**: Frequent `dd()` (die and dump) calls were added and removed (`dd($isProduction);` and `dd($results);`), further highlighting an active debugging phase.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**: This service, responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot, received updates related to its core `syncPlotBoxData` and `processContacts` methods.
    *   **Initial Structure and Error Handling**: The first significant entry on 1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM, shows the introduction of the `processContacts` method with comprehensive `try-catch` blocks for different stages (primary contacts, deceased contacts, deals, associations). It also included `sleep()` calls, likely to manage HubSpot API rate limits.
    *   **Debugging**: Similar to the `Contact.php` file, `dd()` calls were used to inspect batch data at various stages of the sync process (`dd($primaryContactBatch);`, `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`, `dd($dealsBatch);`). These were added, changed, and eventually removed, indicating focused debugging of the data batches before processing.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**: This mapper class facilitates the conversion of PlotBox data to a CRM-compatible format.
    *   **Comprehensive Mapping Logic**: The entry on 1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM, details the implementation of a destructor for resource cleanup, initialization of HubSpot services (`HubSpotOwnerService`, `HubSpotLocationService`), and caching of owner and location lists. It also includes new helper methods (`isValidDate`, `generateDealName`, `getEmailFromJson`) and a `formatMappedFields` method.
    *   **Data Normalization**: The `formatMappedFields` method introduces logic to normalize data for HubSpot, including looking up location IDs, uppercasing states, standardizing relationship texts, mapping pipelines and deal stages, and sanitizing URLs. This indicates a focus on ensuring data quality and consistency during the mapping process.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM**: First clear activation of the dynamic date range filtering in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM**: Major structural update to `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, introducing the detailed contact and deal processing pipeline and initial debugging.
*   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM**: Significant update to `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`, adding comprehensive data mapping and normalization logic.
*   **1/16/2026, 1:39:07 PM**: Introduction of production-specific contract status filtering in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/16/2026, 1:58:05 PM - 2:04:29 PM**: Multiple quick changes in `Contact.php` related to debugging `dd()` calls and temporary inversion/reversion of the production `CONTRACT_STATUS` filter logic.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Debugging**: The most prominent pattern is the frequent addition, modification, and removal of `dd()` statements across both the `Contact` model and `PlotBoxHubSpotService`, often in rapid succession. This strongly suggests an iterative and hands-on debugging process for data retrieval, mapping, and syncing.
*   **SQL Query Refinement**: The SQL query in `Contact.php` for `getDataWithDateRange` was repeatedly modified to switch between hardcoded contract numbers and date-based filtering, indicating testing of specific data sets and the general filtering mechanism.
*   **Production Readiness**: The introduction of environment-specific filters (e.g., `DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS = 'Approved'` only in production) points to a development cycle that includes preparing the code for different deployment environments and ensuring data integrity for production.
*   **Robust HubSpot Integration**: The changes highlight a commitment to building a resilient HubSpot integration, encompassing structured data processing, comprehensive data mapping, and error handling with logging. The `sleep()` calls imply awareness and management of external API rate limits.

## 9:33:08 PM
The `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` file saw frequent updates between January 13-16, 2026. Initially, at 1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM, its `getDataWithDateRange` method used a SQL query with a hardcoded contract number (`'660-1004010262'`) for filtering, with date range filters commented out. This was quickly reversed at 1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM, to enable date range filtering, but then reverted to hardcoded contract numbers several times (e.g., `'Draft-4157894'` at 4:15:07 PM, `'Draft-4157884'` at 4:36:52 PM, `'623-1004011168'` at 4:49:40 PM, and back to `'660-1004010262'` at 5:00:46 PM) throughout January 13, suggesting focused debugging on specific contracts. The date range filtering was re-enabled at 1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM. On 1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM, a `LIMIT 1` clause was added to the SQL query, which was removed on 1/16/2026, 11:00:07 AM. A significant change on 1/16/2026, 1:39:07 PM, introduced environment-specific logic: contracts are now filtered by `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_STATUS = 'Approved'` only in a production environment. This was followed by minor adjustments to the status field name (`DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS`) and the temporary addition and removal of `dd()` debug statements (e.g., `dd($isProduction);` and `dd($results);`) between 1:44:28 PM and 2:04:29 PM, indicating active testing and debugging. The logic for the production filter was briefly inverted at 1/16/2026, 1:58:05 PM, before being corrected to apply the 'Approved' status filter specifically in production environments. The final change at 1/16/2026, 2:58:12 PM, removed the debug `dd()` calls and streamlined the production environment check.

The `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` file was modified on 1/13/2026 at 4:15:17 PM, 4:52:09 PM, and again on 1/14/2026 at 10:13:31 AM, and finally on 1/16/2026 at 11:00:16 AM. These changes consistently involved altering or removing `dd()` debug statements within the `syncPlotBoxData` method, targeting different data batches (`$primaryContactBatch`, `$deceasedContactBatch`, `$dealsBatch`). This indicates ongoing development and debugging of the HubSpot synchronization process itself. The service is structured to handle comprehensive synchronization, including processing and associating primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals with locations, with built-in error logging and resilience for each step.

The `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php` file appears once at 1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM, signifying its creation or a major overhaul at this time. This file defines the `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` class, essential for transforming data from PlotBox into a HubSpot-compatible format. It includes methods (`mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, `mapDeal`) to map various entities, handling field standardization (e.g., uppercasing states, standardizing relationship text), date validation, and mapping PlotBox pipelines/deal stages to HubSpot equivalents (distinguishing 'at-need' and 'pre-need'). It also integrates with HubSpot services to fetch owner and location IDs for mapping. A destructor is implemented for explicit resource cleanup, and `usleep` calls are used to introduce small delays.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
A clear pattern of active development, testing, and debugging is evident, characterized by frequent modifications to SQL queries, particularly the `WHERE` clauses, and the repeated addition and removal of `dd()` debug statements in both the `Contact` model and the `PlotBoxHubSpotService`. The core focus across these changes is the integration of PlotBox data into HubSpot CRM, involving complex data retrieval, transformation, and synchronization. The introduction of environment-specific filters (e.g., 'Approved' contract status only in production) highlights a maturation of the deployment strategy, moving towards more robust and controlled data processing. The consistent use of fully qualified table names within SQL queries indicates reliance on a well-defined data warehousing schema.
