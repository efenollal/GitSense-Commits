# Activity Summary for 1/16/2026

## 3:33:16 AM
The code changes primarily involve two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`. A third file, `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`, was included but showed no functional changes within the provided timestamps.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**:
    *   This file, which defines an Eloquent model for `Contact` and includes a `getDataWithDateRange` method containing a complex Snowflake SQL query, underwent frequent modifications to its SQL `WHERE` clause.
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM:** The SQL query was modified to filter by a specific contract number (`'660-1004010262'`) by uncommenting this line and commenting out the dynamic date-range filtering.
    *   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** The SQL query was reverted to use dynamic date-range filtering, and the hardcoded contract number filter was removed. Additionally, the `Contract_Id` field was temporarily removed from the final `SELECT` statement.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM:** The SQL query reverted again to filtering by the specific contract number `'660-1004010262'`. The `Contract_Id` field was re-added to the final `SELECT` statement, correcting the previous change.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:15:07 PM, 4:23:10 PM, 4:36:52 PM, 4:49:40 PM, 5:00:46 PM:** The hardcoded contract number in the SQL query was repeatedly changed to different values (`'Draft-4157894'`, `'Draft-4157884'`, `'623-1004011168'`, then back to `'660-1004010262'`) across multiple commits, indicating focused testing on individual contract data.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** The SQL query was reverted back to the dynamic date-range filtering mechanism, removing the hardcoded contract number filter.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** A `LIMIT 1` clause was added to the end of the SQL query, likely to restrict the number of results for further testing or debugging.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**:
    *   This service is responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM:** A debugging `dd($primaryContactBatch);` statement was added within the `syncPlotBoxData` method to inspect the primary contact data.
    *   **1/13/2026, 4:52:09 PM:** The debugging statement was changed to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`, shifting the focus to inspecting deceased contact data.
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:55 PM:** The `dd()` statement was removed, allowing the sync process to run further.
    *   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM:** A new `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was added, indicating further debugging efforts, now targeting the deals data batch.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**:
    *   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM:** No functional changes were observed in this log entry for the `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` class. It continues to define mapping logic for contacts (primary and deceased) and deals, including data formatting, date validation, and lookups for HubSpot owners and locations.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM:** Start of specific contract number testing in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** Reversion to dynamic date filter and a temporary structural change in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM:** Introduction of debugging `dd()` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** Final return to dynamic date filtering in `Contact.php` for the day.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:31 AM:** Continued debugging efforts, evidenced by a new `dd()` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/14/2026, 10:13:56 AM:** Addition of `LIMIT 1` to the SQL query in `Contact.php`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Debugging/Testing:** A strong pattern of iterative debugging and testing is evident. In `Contact.php`, the SQL query's `WHERE` clause was repeatedly toggled between a dynamic date range and hardcoded contract numbers, suggesting testing specific data scenarios. Similarly, in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, the use and modification of `dd()` statements (e.g., inspecting `primaryContactBatch`, then `deceasedContactBatch`, then `dealsBatch`) indicates a systematic debugging process.
*   **SQL Query Manipulation:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method in `Contact.php` was a central point of modification, with the core SQL query being frequently adjusted, commented, and uncommented.
*   **Minor Reversions:** Some changes were quickly reverted or corrected (e.g., the removal and re-addition of `Contract_Id`), suggesting a trial-and-error approach during development.
*   **Focus on Data Sync:** The changes overall point to active development and debugging related to the PlotBox data synchronization process with HubSpot CRM, particularly around how contract and contact data is queried and processed.
