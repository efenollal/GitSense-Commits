# Activity Summary for 1/23/2026

## 3:08:24 AM
The codebase changes primarily revolve around two PHP files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`. The timestamps indicate that these changes occurred over two days, January 21st and 22nd, 2026, with the majority of the activity on the `Contact.php` file on the 21st.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**: This file, representing an Eloquent model for 'Contact', contains a complex SQL query within its `getDataWithDateRange` static method.
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM (Initial State):** The query initially filters `DIM_CONTRACT` based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within a given date range. It also conditionally applies a `DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS = 'Approved'` filter in production.
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM to 1/21/2026, 1:37:28 PM:** A significant change was introduced in the `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause. The original date range filtering was commented out (`// (CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN ... )`), and a hardcoded filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` was added. This suggests a temporary change for testing or debugging a specific contract.
    *   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was entirely commented out. Additionally, the `contract_tax_totals` CTE was updated to comment out the `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` part, indicating that cancelled fees are no longer being included in the total tax calculation. This seems like a deliberate change to exclude cancelled contract tax data.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:** In `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, the `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` and `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` were changed to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` and `SUM(df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` respectively. This implies that the `TAX_AMOUNT` property is now expected directly on `DIM_CONTRACT_FEE` (`cf`) and `DIM_DEED_FEE` (`df`) tables, rather than `DIM_FEE` (`f`).
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM:** The `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` condition was changed to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` (capital 'I') in the `contract_fee_tax` CTE. This is a minor casing correction.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:** The `WHERE ... IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` clause within `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs was modified to `WHERE ... IN (CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT))`. This explicitly casts the subquery result to an integer, potentially to address type-matching issues.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM to 1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM:** The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter was changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`, then back to `'645-110814'`, and again to `'110814'`. This suggests repeated testing with different specific contract numbers. Also, the `CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` syntax was changed back to `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` within the `IN` clauses, removing the explicit cast.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM:** In `contract_tax_totals`, there was a brief re-addition of `COALESCE(cft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` in an active line, which was immediately commented out again. This seems like an accidental modification or a test that was quickly reverted.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM to 1/21/2026, 4:29:42 PM:** The line `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` within `contract_tax_totals` was explicitly commented out, then the entire line `//+ // COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax` was re-commented, and finally simplified to `as total_tax` removing the commented portion. This further confirms the decision to exclude `cancelled_fee_tax_total` from the sum.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM to 1/22/2026, 11:25:33 AM:** The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter (`DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'`) was commented out, effectively reactivating the original date range filtering for `base_contracts`. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its reference in `contract_tax_totals` remained commented out. A final adjustment was made to the main `SELECT` statement, adding `LEFT JOIN item_counts ic` and `LEFT JOIN dim_facility df` with specific `ON` conditions to retrieve item counts and facility details, completing the `FROM` and `JOIN` clauses. This indicates the query was made fully functional with the necessary joins.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**: This file handles syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot.
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** An additional `dd($dealsBatch);` line was inserted right before the `processContacts` call within the `syncPlotBoxData` method. `dd()` in Laravel dumps the variable and dies, indicating a debugging step to inspect the `$dealsBatch` variable.
    *   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` line was removed, signifying the completion of the debugging step for that specific variable.
    *   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM to 1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` line was re-introduced. This suggests a re-activation of the debugging process, perhaps to investigate issues related to the `$dealsBatch` again after other changes were made.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM:** Introduction of a hardcoded contract number filter in `Contact.php` for `base_contracts`.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** Commenting out of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` logic in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:** Change in source of `TAX_AMOUNT` for fee calculations in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:** Introduction of explicit `CAST(... AS INT)` in `IN` clauses in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** Reversion to original date range filtering in `Contact.php` and completion of `SELECT` clause joins.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** Initial debugging `dd()` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** Removal of `dd()` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM:** Re-introduction of `dd()` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging:** The most prominent pattern is the frequent use and removal of a hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter in `Contact.php` and the `dd($dealsBatch);` statement in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`. This indicates an active debugging process throughout these changes, likely focused on specific data scenarios or issues in the data synchronization flow.
*   **SQL Query Refinement:** A continuous effort to refine the large SQL query in `Contact.php` is evident. This includes:
    *   Changes to tax calculation logic (`TAX_AMOUNT` source, exclusion of cancelled fees).
    *   Attempts to resolve potential type casting issues (`CAST AS INT` and its subsequent removal).
    *   Iterative testing with specific contract numbers.
    *   Gradual completion of the final `SELECT` clause joins (`item_counts`, `dim_facility`).
*   **Modularity (or lack thereof):** The very large SQL query within a single PHP method suggests a monolithic approach to data retrieval for the `Contact` model, which could be a source of complexity and frequent changes.
*   **Environment-specific logic:** The `$contractStatusFilter` demonstrates a pattern of having production-specific filtering for data.
*   **Consistent Model Structure:** The `Contact` model itself (namespaces, `use` statements, `CONNECTION`, `table`, `primaryKey`, `timestamps`, `fillable`, and relationships) remains largely unchanged, indicating stability in the model's core definition. The changes are focused entirely on the `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL logic.

## 4:08:24 AM
The changes primarily revolve around two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

**File-specific Updates:**

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
This file, representing an Eloquent model for contacts in a PlotBox system, contains a `getDataWithDateRange` static method responsible for querying detailed contract and contact information from a Snowflake data warehouse.

The changes in this file across multiple timestamps (1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM to 1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM) indicate a series of iterative debugging and refinement efforts on the complex SQL query within the `getDataWithDateRange` method.

*   **Initial State (1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM):** The query fetches data based on a date range for `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` in `DIM_CONTRACT` or `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` in `DIM_CONTACT` (via `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`). It includes subqueries for `payment_schedule_totals`, `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`, `contract_tax_totals`, `contract_net_prices`, `contract_writers`, `item_counts`, `primary_contacts`, and `deceased_contacts`.
*   **Debugging Contract Number (1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM):** A specific filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` was uncommented and the original date range filter was commented out in the `base_contracts` CTE. This suggests a focused effort to test the query with a particular contract. The contract number was later changed to `'110814'` at 1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM. This single-contract filtering was maintained for several subsequent commits.
*   **Refinement of Tax Calculations (1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM - 1/21/2026, 4:32:48 PM):**
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was commented out at 1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM, and its inclusion in `contract_tax_totals` was also commented out.
    *   Subsequent changes (e.g., 1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM, 1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM) involved correcting the column used for summing tax amounts in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` from `f.TAX_AMOUNT` to `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` and `df.TAX_AMOUNT` respectively. The casing of 'interest' in the `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` clause was also adjusted to `'Interest'`.
    *   Attempts were made to cast `SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts` to `INT` within the `WHERE IN` clauses for `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` (e.g., 1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM, 4:20:13 PM, 4:20:28 PM, 4:23:56 PM). These `CAST` operations were subsequently removed, indicating they were either unnecessary or caused issues.
    *   The reference to `ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total` in `contract_tax_totals` was uncommented then re-commented, suggesting a fluctuating decision on its inclusion.
*   **Restoration of Date Range Filter (1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM):** The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter was commented out, and the original date range filter for `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` and `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` was re-enabled, likely signifying the completion of single-contract debugging.
*   **Final Join Order/Completeness (1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM - 1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM):** The final `SELECT` statement in the SQL query had missing `LEFT JOIN` clauses for `contract_writers`, `item_counts`, and `DIM_FACILITY` (`df`) in several intermediate versions. The last version (1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM) shows these joins correctly placed at the end, along with a join to `DIM_FACILITY` (`df`) for `df.FACILITY_ID = pc.FACILITY_ID`. The very last log entry for this file at 1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM seems to revert to an earlier state or trim the end of the file. However, the last fully displayed content (1/22/2026, 11:25:33 AM) shows a complete and corrected set of joins for the final `SELECT`.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
This file handles the synchronization of PlotBox data to HubSpot, including contacts, deals, and location associations.

*   **Debugging `dd($dealsBatch)` (1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM - 1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM):** The primary change here is the presence and subsequent removal of a `dd($dealsBatch);` statement within the `syncPlotBoxData` method. This `dd` (dump and die) statement is a debugging tool in Laravel/PHP, suggesting that the developer was inspecting the contents of the `$dealsBatch` array before further processing. It was present at 12:54:56 PM and 11:24:34 AM, and removed (implicitly, as it's not in the 11:19:31 AM version, but reappears briefly) from the 11:19:31 AM version.
*   **Minor Content Similarity (1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM - 1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM):** The content between these timestamps is identical. The `dd($dealsBatch);` was present again, possibly indicating a re-introduction for further debugging or a local file saving without changes.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM:** Introduction of a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter for debugging.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** Commenting out of the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its reference, simplifying tax calculation.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM - 4:20:08 PM:** Correction of tax amount column references (`f.TAX_AMOUNT` to `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` or `df.TAX_AMOUNT`) and attempts to `CAST` `CONTRACT_ID` to `INT` within subqueries, which were later reverted.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** Reversion from hardcoded contract number to the original date range filter, indicating completion of specific contract debugging.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM:** Final correction of the `SELECT` statement's `LEFT JOIN` clauses in the `Contact.php` model, ensuring all necessary subquery results are correctly joined.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM & 1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM:** Temporary inclusion of `dd($dealsBatch)` for debugging in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative SQL Query Debugging:** The `Contact.php` file shows a clear pattern of iterative development and debugging on a complex SQL query. This involved commenting/uncommenting filters, adjusting column names, experimenting with type casting, and refining join conditions within the Snowflake query.
*   **Focus on `getDataWithDateRange`:** All significant changes in `Contact.php` are confined to the `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query.
*   **HubSpot Service Debugging:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` indicates debugging activities related to data mapping and batch processing, marked by the temporary inclusion of `dd($dealsBatch);`.
*   **Consistent File Paths:** All changes are within the `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\` directory, specifically `app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.
*   **Date Formats:** The `fromDate` and `toDate` parameters in `getDataWithDateRange` consistently expect `Y-m-d` format.
*   **Snowflake Connection:** Both files implicitly or explicitly use a 'snowflake' database connection.
*   **Repetitive Content:** Several log entries for `Contact.php` contain identical or near-identical code, especially where only small, specific changes (like commenting/uncommenting a line) were made, or where the change was minor and was then reverted. This suggests frequent saving or small, isolated modifications.

## 9:23:17 AM
The recent changes primarily focus on two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
This file, a Laravel Eloquent model for `Contact` data, defines relationships and a `getDataWithDateRange` static method that executes a complex Snowflake SQL query. The changes to this file revolve entirely around modifying and commenting out parts of the SQL query within this `getDataWithDateRange` method.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM**: The initial state of the `getDataWithDateRange` method includes filtering `DIM_CONTRACT` based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within a specified date range. It also includes a `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and sums its `cancelled_fee_tax_total` into `contract_tax_totals`. The final `SELECT` statement ends abruptly.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM**: The primary date range filtering condition in the `base_contracts` CTE is commented out. A new, specific filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` is introduced, suggesting testing or debugging. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remains active. The final `SELECT` statement remains truncated.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM**: No functional changes. The SQL query remains the same as the previous timestamp. The final `SELECT` statement remains truncated.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM**: The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE is now entirely commented out. Consequently, the `contract_tax_totals` CTE also has its `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` line commented out. The specific `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` filter persists. The final `SELECT` statement remains truncated.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM**: In `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, the `SUM` calculation now explicitly uses `cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY` instead of `f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY` and `cf.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY` respectively. This indicates a correction in how tax amounts are being aggregated from contract and deed fees. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its inclusion in `contract_tax_totals` remain commented out. The final `SELECT` statement remains truncated.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM**: Similar to the previous change, the `SUM` calculation in `deed_fee_tax` is corrected to `SUM(df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)`. The condition `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` in `contract_fee_tax` is changed to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` (case adjustment for 'Interest'). The specific `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter and the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE persist. The final `SELECT` statement remains truncated.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM**: The `WHERE` clauses for `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE are updated to include `CAST(... AS INT)` around the subquery `SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts`. This suggests a type casting issue or explicit requirement for integer contract IDs. The `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter remains `'645-110814'`. The final `SELECT` statement remains truncated.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM**: The specific `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter in `base_contracts` is changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`. The `CAST(... AS INT)` changes from the previous timestamp are still present. The final `SELECT` statement remains truncated.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:28 PM**: No functional changes. The SQL query remains the same as the previous timestamp. The final `SELECT` statement remains truncated.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM**: The `CAST(... AS INT)` for the subqueries in `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE are adjusted. Specifically, `IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` is changed to `IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` in `contract_fee_tax`, and `IN SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` is malformed in `deed_fee_tax` (missing parenthesis). This indicates potential syntax issues or attempts to correct casting. The final `SELECT` statement remains truncated.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM**: The `CAST(... AS INT)` from `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE is removed, reverting to `IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)`. This likely suggests that the explicit casting was not needed or caused issues. The specific `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter and commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` persist. The final `SELECT` statement remains truncated.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM**: In the `contract_tax_totals` CTE, the commented line `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax` is modified to `COALESCE(cft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax`, referencing `cft` instead of `ccft` which doesn't exist anymore due to commenting out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`. This change, while still commented out, indicates an error in the original commented logic. The final `SELECT` statement remains truncated.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM**: The incorrect reference `COALESCE(cft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` in `contract_tax_totals` is corrected back to `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)`, even though the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE itself remains commented out. The commented `+ // COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` from the `total_tax` calculation in `contract_tax_totals` is now on a new line. The final `SELECT` statement remains truncated.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM**: The commented `+ // COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` line in `contract_tax_totals` is moved back to the original line, immediately following `COALESCE(dft.deed_fee_tax_total, 0)`. Functionally, no changes. The final `SELECT` statement remains truncated.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM**: The specific `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` filter in `base_contracts` is commented out. The original date range filter for `DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` and `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` is uncommented and reactivated, effectively restoring the primary filtering logic. The comments for `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its inclusion in `contract_tax_totals` persist. The final `SELECT` statement remains truncated.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:32:48 PM**: No functional changes. The SQL query remains the same as the previous timestamp. The `SELECT` statement is still abruptly cut off, indicating incomplete log capture for this section or a persistent state in the file.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM**: The SQL query's `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE is completely removed (not just commented out) along with its reference in `contract_tax_totals`. This simplifies the tax calculation logic. Crucially, the final `SELECT` statement, which was truncated in all previous logs, is now complete, joining `primary_contacts`, `deceased_contacts`, `contract_writers`, `contract_net_prices`, `item_counts`, and `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_FACILITY` to produce the final output columns. This marks a significant completion of the SQL query.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
This file handles syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM**: Introduces a `dd($dealsBatch)` call (a `die/dump` function used for debugging) immediately after populating the batches for primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals. This would halt execution and display the contents of `$dealsBatch`.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM**: The `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging line is removed, allowing the `syncPlotBoxData` method to proceed with its intended logic (processing contacts, deals, and associations). This indicates the completion of a debugging phase.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM**: The `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging line is re-introduced. This suggests a reversion or a new debugging session.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM**: The `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging line is removed again, indicating another completion of a debugging step.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM**: Introduction of a hardcoded contract number filter in `Contact.php` for `base_contracts` and commenting out the date range filter, likely for debugging a specific contract.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM**: Introduction of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, marking the start of a debugging session for HubSpot deal data.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM**: Commenting out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE in `Contact.php`, simplifying the tax calculation logic.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM & 4:16:07 PM**: Corrections in `SUM` calculations for `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` in `Contact.php`, implying a fix for tax amount aggregation.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM - 4:26:14 PM**: Series of changes related to `CAST` operations and their subsequent removal for `CONTRACT_ID` subqueries in `Contact.php`, indicating trial-and-error in SQL query refinement.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM**: Reversion of the `base_contracts` filter in `Contact.php` from a hardcoded contract number to the original date range, suggesting the completion of contract-specific testing.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM**: Removal of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, indicating progression beyond an initial debugging step.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM**: Complete removal of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its reference in `Contact.php`, and the completion of the `SELECT` statement, signifying a major structural and functional update to the data retrieval logic.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging via Hardcoding/Commenting**: A consistent pattern in `Contact.php` is the use of commenting out the primary date filter and hardcoding a `CONTRACT_NUMBER` (`'645-110814'` then `'110814'`) in the `base_contracts` CTE, and then reverting it. This suggests iterative debugging of the complex SQL query for specific contract data.
*   **SQL Query Refinement**: There are multiple small corrections and adjustments within the SQL query in `Contact.php`, such as fixing `SUM` logic, trying `CAST(... AS INT)` and then removing it, and ultimately removing the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE. This points to ongoing development and stabilization of the data extraction logic.
*   **Incomplete Log Captures**: Several log entries for `Contact.php` show the code abruptly ending, especially the final `SELECT` statement of the SQL query. This is likely due to the logging mechanism capturing a partial file state at the time of the change. The full SQL query only appears in the last `Contact.php` entry.
*   **HubSpot Service Debugging**: The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` file shows a pattern of adding and removing `dd($dealsBatch)`, indicating a focused debugging effort on the deal data processing flow, possibly in conjunction with the changes to the `Contact.php` data source.
*   **Focus on Data Extraction and Sync**: Both files are part of a data pipeline where `Contact.php` extracts data from a Snowflake warehouse and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` prepares and syncs this data to HubSpot. The changes reflect continuous efforts to ensure accurate data extraction and smooth integration with HubSpot.

## 10:23:13 AM
The changes primarily involve two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

### File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`

This file, a Laravel Eloquent model named `Contact`, is responsible for querying and processing contact and contract data from a Snowflake data warehouse (`PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS`). It defines relationships (`contractOwners`, `contracts`) and, most notably, contains a `getDataWithDateRange` static method that executes a complex SQL query.

**Key Changes and Timestamps:**

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM:** Initial version of the `getDataWithDateRange` method. The `WHERE` clause in the `base_contracts` CTE filters contracts by `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within a given date range. There's also a `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and a corresponding `LEFT JOIN` and `COALESCE` in `contract_tax_totals`.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM:**
    *   **Significant Change:** The date range filter in the `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause is commented out.
    *   **New Filter:** A hardcoded filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` is introduced, suggesting testing or debugging for a specific contract.
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remains active.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM:** No functional changes, but the code content indicates a continued state of testing with the hardcoded contract number filter. The very end of the file output is truncated, but the preceding changes are consistent.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:**
    *   **Significant Change:** The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE is commented out.
    *   The `contract_tax_totals` CTE is modified to comment out the `LEFT JOIN` and `COALESCE` related to `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`.
    *   The hardcoded contract number filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` persists.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:**
    *   **Minor Fix/Refinement:** In `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, the `SUM` aggregates now correctly use `cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY` and `df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY` respectively, instead of `f.TAX_AMOUNT` or `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` (which was likely a typo as `cf` isn't available for `TAX_AMOUNT` in `deed_fee_tax` from its join context).
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remains commented out.
    *   The hardcoded contract number filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` persists.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM:**
    *   **Minor Change:** The comparison `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` is changed to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` in the `contract_fee_tax` CTE. This is a case-sensitivity change.
    *   The hardcoded contract number filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` persists.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:**
    *   **Minor Change:** `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` is changed to `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT))` in `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE. This explicitly casts the subquery result to `INT`.
    *   The hardcoded contract number filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` persists.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM:**
    *   **Minor Change:** The hardcoded contract number filter is changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:28 PM:** No functional changes from the previous timestamp, continuing with the hardcoded contract number `'110814'`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM:**
    *   **Syntax Error Fix (Attempted):** The `CAST` operation around the subquery `SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts` in `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE is incorrectly applied. It changes from `IN (CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT))` to `IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` (missing parenthesis after `IN`) or `IN SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` (missing parenthesis and `(`). This introduces a syntax error.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM:**
    *   **Reverted Syntax Error:** The incorrect `CAST` and missing parentheses in the `WHERE ... IN` clauses are reverted back to `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)`, removing the `CAST` entirely.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM:**
    *   **Typo Correction (Introduced?):** In the `contract_tax_totals` CTE, `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` is changed to `COALESCE(cft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)`. This seems like a typo, as `cft` refers to `contract_fee_tax_total`, not `cancelled_fee_tax_total`, and `ccft` (cancelled contract fee tax) is commented out anyway. The intent might have been to remove it completely, but a different alias was used.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM:**
    *   **Typo Correction (Fixed):** The likely typo from the previous commit is corrected by commenting out `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` from the `contract_tax_totals` CTE, aligning with the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM:** No functional changes, continuing the state from the previous commit.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:**
    *   **Reverted Filter:** The hardcoded contract number filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` is commented out, restoring the original date range filtering logic in the `base_contracts` CTE.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:32:48 PM:** No functional changes, identical to the previous entry, indicating possibly a save operation or minor non-code change.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM:**
    *   **Cleanup/Removal:** The commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE is completely removed from the SQL query. The `contract_tax_totals` CTE is simplified accordingly, removing the commented `LEFT JOIN` and `COALESCE` for `ccft`.
    *   **Final SELECT additions:** The final `SELECT` statement now includes `ic.private_estates_owned, ic.urns_owned, ic.vaults_owned` and correctly joins `item_counts` and `facility` tables to the `primary_contacts` data.
*   **1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM:** No functional changes, identical to the previous entry, indicating possibly a save operation or minor non-code change.

### File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`

This file is a service responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot, handling contact, deal, and location associations.

**Key Changes and Timestamps:**

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** Initial version of the `PlotBoxHubSpotService`.
    *   The `syncPlotBoxData` method fetches data, maps it, and then prepares batches for primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals.
    *   **Debugging Line:** It contains a `dd($dealsBatch);` (dump and die) statement after populating the batches, which would halt execution for inspection.
    *   The `processContacts` method outlines the logic for searching, creating, updating contacts and deals, and associating them with locations, including `sleep()` calls between operations, likely to manage API rate limits or ensure previous operations complete in HubSpot.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:**
    *   **Significant Change:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` line in the `syncPlotBoxData` method is removed. This suggests that the debugging step related to inspecting the `dealsBatch` was completed, and the full sync process is now intended to run.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM:**
    *   **Reintroduced Debugging Line:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` line is re-added in the `syncPlotBoxData` method. This indicates a re-enablement of a debugging breakpoint, possibly due to further issues encountered during the sync process.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM:** No functional changes, identical to the previous entry, showing the `dd($dealsBatch);` still present.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **File Specificity:** The logs show focused work on two distinct files, one for data retrieval (`Contact.php`) and one for data synchronization (`PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`).
*   **SQL Query Iteration (`Contact.php`):**
    *   Frequent modifications, commenting out, and uncommenting of `WHERE` clauses (specifically the date range filter vs. a hardcoded contract number) in `getDataWithDateRange` indicate extensive testing and debugging of the underlying SQL query.
    *   Repeated addition/removal/modification of the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its integration into `contract_tax_totals` suggests refinement of tax calculation logic.
    *   Minor syntax adjustments like `CAST` and case sensitivity (`'interest'` vs `'Interest'`) point to resolving specific database or SQL parsing issues.
    *   The final changes in `Contact.php` at `1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM` seem to represent a more finalized state of the SQL query, with the date range filter re-enabled and the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` part removed, suggesting that calculation is no longer needed or is handled differently.
*   **Debugging (`PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`):** The repeated addition and removal of `dd($dealsBatch);` signifies an iterative debugging process, where the developer likely inspected the data being prepared for HubSpot at a specific stage of the sync flow.
*   **Timestamp Pattern:** All changes occur within a short, concentrated period across two days (January 21st and 22nd, 2026), indicating active development or troubleshooting. The multiple quick saves within minutes suggest rapid iteration, testing, and small adjustments.

## 12:23:12 PM
The provided logs detail changes across two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

### File-Specific Updates:

#### `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`

**Timestamps:** 1/21/2026, from 12:51:05 PM to 4:32:48 PM, and 1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM to 11:25:33 AM.

The primary focus of changes in this file revolves around the `getDataWithDateRange` static method, which executes a complex SQL query to retrieve contact and contract data from a Snowflake warehouse.

*   **Initial State (1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM):** The SQL query correctly filters `base_contracts` by `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within a specified date range. It includes `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` in the `contract_tax_totals` calculation and the final `SELECT` statement.
*   **Debug-related Modifications (1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 1:37:28 PM):** The `WHERE` clause within the `base_contracts` CTE (Common Table Expression) was commented out to filter by a specific contract number: `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'`. This suggests debugging or testing for a particular contract. The SQL query remains truncated at the end across multiple commits, indicated by `...COALESCE(ic.other_services_owned, 0)`.
*   **Further Debugging and Removal of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` (1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM):**
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was fully commented out.
    *   The `contract_tax_totals` CTE was updated to remove `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` from its sum, aligning with the commented-out CTE. The SQL truncation persists.
*   **Minor Syntax Correction and Continued Debugging (1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM):**
    *   Within the `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, the `SUM()` function arguments were changed from `f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY` to `cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY` and `df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY` respectively. This seems like a correction, assuming `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` and `df.TAX_AMOUNT` are the correct columns for the tax amount on the contract/deed fee tables themselves.
    *   The `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` was changed to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` in `contract_fee_tax`, indicating a case sensitivity adjustment for the 'interest' fee type.
*   **Removal of `CAST` operations (1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM):**
    *   `CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` was simplified to `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` in the `WHERE` clauses of `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, implying the `CAST` was either unnecessary or causing issues. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remained commented out.
*   **Final SQL Query Cleanup (1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM - 4:32:48 PM, and 1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM - 11:25:33 AM):**
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remains commented out.
    *   The `contract_tax_totals` CTE consistently excludes `cancelled_fee_tax_total`.
    *   The specific contract number filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` or `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` was eventually commented out, restoring the date range filtering logic to `base_contracts`. This suggests the debugging phase concluded.
    *   The SQL query truncation `...COALESCE(ic.other_services_owned, 0)` was resolved in the last commit (1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM), revealing the full final `SELECT` statement with `item_counts` joins and all the `COALESCE` statements, and also showing joins to `DIM_FACILITY`, `DIM_CONTRACT_WRITER`, and `item_counts`.

#### `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`

**Timestamps:** 1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM and 1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM, 11:25:42 AM.

*   **Initial and Subsequent States:** The file's content is largely consistent across the logs. The core functionality is to sync PlotBox data to HubSpot, handling primary and deceased contacts, deals, and location associations.
*   **Key Change (1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM - 11:25:42 AM):** The `dd($dealsBatch);` line, which is a Laravel helper for "dump and die" (stopping execution and displaying variables for debugging), was removed from the `syncPlotBoxData` method. This indicates the completion of a debugging phase in the HubSpot service.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

1.  **Debugging Focus:** A significant pattern is the insertion and subsequent removal/commenting out of specific debug-related code:
    *   In `Contact.php`, temporarily filtering by a specific `CONTRACT_NUMBER` (`'645-110814'` or `'110814'`) and commenting out the primary date-range filter for `base_contracts`.
    *   In `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, the use of `dd($dealsBatch);` for inspection during data synchronization.
2.  **SQL Query Refinement:** The `Contact.php` file shows iterative refinements to a large SQL query within the `getDataWithDateRange` method. This includes:
    *   Temporarily excluding `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` calculation.
    *   Correcting column names (`f.TAX_AMOUNT` to `cf.TAX_AMOUNT`/`df.TAX_AMOUNT`) and case sensitivity (`'interest'` to `'Interest'`) in tax calculations.
    *   Removing `CAST` operations within subqueries for `CONTRACT_ID`.
3.  **Consistency in Core Logic:** Despite the debugging adjustments, the overall structure of the `getDataWithDateRange` method (using multiple CTEs like `base_contracts`, `payment_schedule_totals`, `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, `contract_tax_totals`, `contract_net_prices`, `contract_writers`, `item_counts`, `primary_contacts`, `deceased_contacts`) and the `PlotBoxHubSpotService` (handling contact, deal, and location syncing) remains stable.
4.  **Laravel and Snowflake Integration:** Both files demonstrate an application interacting with a Snowflake database (via `DB::connection('snowflake')`) and using Laravel's Eloquent ORM features and logging.
5.  **Partial Code Logs:** Many of the `Contact.php` entries show truncated code, specifically at the end of the long SQL `SELECT` statement, suggesting the logs might be capturing only the changed portions or have a character limit. The final log entry for `Contact.php` (1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM) seems to include the complete `SELECT` statement.

## 1:23:11 PM
The changes primarily revolve around two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

### File-Specific Updates:

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`** (multiple timestamps from 1/21/2026 12:51:05 PM to 1/22/2026 2:29:50 PM)

This file, a Laravel Eloquent model named `Contact`, is responsible for querying PlotBox contract and contact data from a Snowflake warehouse. The `getDataWithDateRange` static method contains a complex SQL query with multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to gather comprehensive contract and contact details.

The key changes observed across several commits are iterative modifications to the SQL query within the `getDataWithDateRange` method, specifically focusing on the `WHERE` clauses and the `COALESCE` functions in tax calculations.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM (Initial State):** The `base_contracts` CTE initially filters by `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within a date range (`$fromDate` and `$toDate`). It also includes `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` as a separate CTE and incorporates its `cancelled_fee_tax_total` into `contract_tax_totals`.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM and 1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM:** A significant change was introduced in the `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause. The original date range filtering logic for both `DIM_CONTRACT` and `DIM_CONTACT` was commented out. Instead, a hardcoded filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` was added, suggesting a temporary debugging or specific contract testing scenario. The `COALESCE` function in `contract_net_prices` also changed from `COALESCE(cnp.net_price, pc.TOTAL_CASH_PRICE, 0)` to `COALESCE(cnp.net_price, 0)`.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was entirely commented out, and its reference in `contract_tax_totals` was also commented out. This indicates a decision to temporarily or permanently exclude cancelled contract fees from the total tax calculation.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:** In `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, the `SUM` aggregate function was changed. Instead of `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)`, it became `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` and `SUM(df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` respectively. This implies a correction in how the tax amount was being accessed (from `f` (fee) table to `cf` (contract fee) or `df` (deed fee) table). The `FEE_TYPE` check for 'interest' also became case-insensitive (`LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'`).
*   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM:** The `FEE_TYPE` check for 'Interest' was updated to use proper casing: `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'`. Additionally, the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` was modified internally to `COALESCE(SUM(ccf.TAX_AMOUNT * ccf.QUANTITY), 0)`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:** The `WHERE` clause for `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` was modified. The `IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` subquery was wrapped with a `CAST(... AS INT)`, suggesting a type casting issue or explicit conversion requirement for `CONTRACT_ID`. The hardcoded contract number filter in `base_contracts` also changed from '645-110814' to '110814'.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM:** The `CAST(... AS INT)` for the `IN` subquery in `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` was slightly altered, potentially correcting syntax (e.g., `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` vs `(CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT))`).
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM:** The `CAST(... AS INT)` was removed from the `IN` subquery for `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` also reverted, suggesting the explicit casting was not needed or caused issues.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM:** The `contract_tax_totals` CTE was adjusted. The commented out `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` was re-added but still commented out, and an explicit `cft.cancelled_fee_tax_total` (which is not available from `contract_fee_tax`) was added to the `COALESCE` sum, implying a potential logic error or incomplete re-introduction of cancelled fees.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM:** The erroneous `cft.cancelled_fee_tax_total` was removed from `contract_tax_totals`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM:** The hardcoded `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` comment in `contract_tax_totals` was slightly adjusted (moved a `//+`).
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter in `base_contracts` was commented out, effectively reactivating the date range filtering for `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` and `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:32:48 PM:** No significant change in content, appears to be a save operation.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM and 1/22/2026, 11:24:43 AM and 1/22/2026, 11:25:33 AM and 1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM:** In these changes, the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its reference in `contract_tax_totals` are removed entirely (not just commented out). This makes the removal of cancelled fees from total tax permanent. The final `SELECT` statement now explicitly joins `item_counts` and other CTEs.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`** (timestamps: 1/21/2026 12:54:56 PM, 1/22/2026 11:19:31 AM, 1/22/2026 11:24:34 AM, 1/22/2026 11:25:42 AM)

This file is a service responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** An explicit `dd($dealsBatch);` (die and dump) statement was added within the `syncPlotBoxData` method, just before the `processContacts` call. This is typically used for debugging purposes to inspect the `$dealsBatch` variable. The `processedContactsIds` array assignment in `processContacts` was changed from `=$this->contactCrm->...` to `[]=$this->contactCrm->...`, ensuring new elements are added to the array instead of overwriting it. The `mergedContactsIds` array also received similar treatment.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was removed, indicating the debugging step was complete or no longer needed.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM and 1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was re-added. This suggests intermittent debugging of the deal batch during the development or testing phase.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 12:54:01 PM:** Introduction of hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter in `Contact.php` for targeted data fetching.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** Introduction of `dd($dealsBatch)` debug statement and array assignment corrections in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** Temporary/permanent removal of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` calculations in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:** Correction of tax amount source and case-insensitivity for `FEE_TYPE` in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:** Introduction of `CAST(... AS INT)` for subqueries and contract number filter change in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM:** Reversal of `CAST(... AS INT)` for subqueries in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** Reversion to date range filtering from hardcoded contract number in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** Removal of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM:** Permanent removal of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and related logic in `Contact.php`.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Iterative SQL Query Refinement:** The `Contact.php` file shows a consistent pattern of modifying and debugging the complex SQL query for `getDataWithDateRange`. This includes commenting/uncommenting sections, changing `WHERE` clauses (e.g., date range vs. specific contract ID), and adjusting aggregate functions and type casting.
*   **Debugging with `dd()`:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` file shows a repeated pattern of adding and removing `dd($dealsBatch);`, indicating active debugging sessions to inspect the data flow at a specific point.
*   **Focus on Tax Calculation Logic:** Several changes in `Contact.php` specifically target the calculation of `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`, suggesting that tax calculation accuracy or logic was a central point of development or troubleshooting.
*   **Temporary vs. Permanent Changes:** The initial commenting out of date filters and `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` in `Contact.php`, followed by later un-commenting or permanent removal, indicates an iterative development process involving temporary changes for testing and subsequent finalization.
*   **Consistent File Paths:** All changes occur within the `datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` files, highlighting a focused area of development.
*   **Future-Dated Timestamps:** All timestamps are dated 1/21/2026 or 1/22/2026, which are in the future, suggesting these logs might be from a development environment where dates are set forward or are placeholder dates.

## 3:23:11 PM
The codebase changes predominantly focus on two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
This file, representing an Eloquent model for contacts in a "PlotBox" system, saw numerous small, iterative changes primarily within its `getDataWithDateRange` method. This method executes a complex Snowflake SQL query to retrieve contract-related data, including primary and deceased contacts, contract details, pricing, and item counts, filtered by a date range.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM (Initial State/Significant Baseline):** The method includes a `contractStatusFilter` for production environments, and the `base_contracts` CTE initially filters by `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `dc.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within the given date range. A `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE is present and its `cancelled_fee_tax_total` is included in `contract_tax_totals`. The final `SELECT` statement joins various CTEs to produce a comprehensive dataset.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:** During this period, the main change was the introduction of a hardcoded filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` into the `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause. Crucially, the original date range and `EXISTS` subquery filters were commented out. This suggests a temporary change for testing or debugging a specific contract.
    *   Around **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was commented out, and its corresponding join (`LEFT JOIN cancelled_contract_fee_tax ccft ON bc.CONTRACT_ID = ccft.CONTRACT_ID`) and `COALESCE` sum in `contract_tax_totals` were also commented. This indicates an intention to temporarily or permanently remove calculations related to cancelled contract fees.
    *   Around **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:** The `SUM` aggregate for `contract_fee_tax_total` and `deed_fee_tax_total` was modified. Previously, it used `f.TAX_AMOUNT`. In this update, `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` (for `contract_fee_tax`) and `df.TAX_AMOUNT` (for `deed_fee_tax`) were introduced, suggesting a correction or change in how tax amounts are retrieved from the `_CONTRACT_FEE` and `_DEED_FEE` tables, respectively, instead of directly from the `DIM_FEE` table.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM:** The `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` condition was changed to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` in `contract_fee_tax`, capitalizing 'Interest'.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM - 1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM:** A new change involved casting the subquery result `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` to `INT` within the `WHERE ... IN` clauses for `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`. Additionally, the hardcoded contract number filter in `base_contracts` was changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM:** A syntax error was introduced in the `deed_fee_tax` CTE: `WHERE df.CONTRACT_ID IN SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` missing parentheses around the `SELECT` subquery. The `CAST` from `4:20:08 PM` was removed for `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax`, but kept for `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` (which was still commented out).
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM - 1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM:** The `CAST((SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT))` was removed, reverting to `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` in the `WHERE ... IN` clauses for fee-related CTEs. A `dd($dealsBatch)` statement was found in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` at 12:54:56 PM, indicating a debugging step.
    *   Around **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM:** A typo was introduced in `contract_tax_totals`, changing `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` to `COALESCE(cft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)`, incorrectly referencing `cft` (contract fee tax) instead of `ccft` (cancelled contract fee tax) for the cancelled fee tax total.
    *   Around **1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM:** This typo was partially fixed, with the line `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` in `contract_tax_totals` being commented out entirely, alongside the `LEFT JOIN cancelled_contract_fee_tax ccft`.
    *   Around **1/21/2026, 4:29:42 PM:** The remaining `//+ // COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax` comment was slightly adjusted.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` filter in `base_contracts` was commented out, effectively re-enabling the original date range filtering and `EXISTS` subquery logic.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM:** The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE, along with its associated `LEFT JOIN` and `COALESCE` sum in `contract_tax_totals`, was completely removed, not just commented out. This seems to be a permanent removal of cancelled contract fee tax calculation.
*   **1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM:** The last update to this file shows the code reverted to its initial state from 1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM, with the removal of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its reference being the only significant difference, and the commenting out of the hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filters.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
This file handles syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot, involving contact, deal, and location associations.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** This version introduces a `dd($dealsBatch)` statement immediately after populating the batch arrays within the `syncPlotBoxData` method. This `dd()` (dump and die) statement is a debugging tool that would halt script execution and display the contents of `$dealsBatch`.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` statement was removed, indicating the debugging step was either completed or no longer needed, allowing the sync process to continue.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` statement was re-introduced in the same location as the 12:54:56 PM entry, again suggesting re-initiation of a debugging step.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` statement was removed again, returning the file to its state from 11:19:31 AM.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM:** Baseline for `Contact.php` showing initial SQL query structure.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** This roughly 4-hour window was characterized by extensive iterative changes and debugging in `Contact.php`, particularly modifying the `WHERE` clause of the `base_contracts` CTE (commenting/uncommenting date filters, adding specific contract numbers) and handling of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` (commenting out, temporary removal, typo introduction/fix).
*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** Introduction of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` for debugging.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** Removal of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM:** Re-introduction of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM:** Final removal of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM:** The final state of `Contact.php` represents a near revert to an earlier version, with the permanent removal of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` as the key difference from the initial log entry.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging via Hardcoding and `dd()`:** A prominent pattern is the repeated modification of the SQL query in `Contact.php` to include a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '...'` filter, and the concurrent commenting/uncommenting of the original date range filter. This strongly suggests developers were debugging specific contract data. Similarly, the repeated addition and removal of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` confirms active debugging efforts for data processing and mapping.
*   **SQL Query Refinement:** Within `Contact.php`, there were ongoing adjustments to the complex SQL query, specifically concerning the calculation of `total_tax` and the inclusion/exclusion of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`. There were also attempts to cast subquery results to `INT`, indicating type-related issues or attempts at performance/correctness improvements in Snowflake queries.
*   **Focus on Data Synchronization:** Both files are integral to a data synchronization process from a PlotBox system to HubSpot. `Contact.php` is responsible for extracting the raw data from a Snowflake warehouse, and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` processes and pushes that data to HubSpot.
*   **Iterative Development and Reversion:** The log shows a pattern of making a change, sometimes introducing minor errors (like the `CAST AS INT` syntax or the `cft.cancelled_fee_tax_total` typo), then quickly correcting or reverting parts of the changes, especially in `Contact.php`. The final state of `Contact.php` is very similar to its initial state, implying that many of the temporary changes were indeed for testing and were eventually discarded.

## 4:23:12 PM
The log details changes to two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**: This file, representing a Laravel Eloquent Model for `Contact` data from a Snowflake warehouse, underwent numerous small changes throughout January 21-22, 2026.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM**: Initial state, or a baseline from which subsequent changes are made. The `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query includes a `WHERE` clause that filters `DIM_CONTRACT` based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within a specified date range. It also includes a `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and a reference to `ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total` in `contract_tax_totals`.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM**: A significant change was introduced in the `getDataWithDateRange` method. The original date range filter in the `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause was commented out and replaced with a hardcoded filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'`. This suggests a shift from date-based filtering to specific contract number filtering, likely for testing or debugging a particular contract. The `contract_fee_tax_total` and `deed_fee_tax_total` calculations still refer to `f.TAX_AMOUNT`.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM**: No discernible change from the previous entry. The `WHERE` clause remains hardcoded.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM**: The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its reference in `contract_tax_totals` were commented out. This indicates that the calculation of `total_tax` no longer includes cancelled contract fees. The hardcoded contract number filter remains.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM**: The calculation for `contract_fee_tax_total` and `deed_fee_tax_total` was updated. Previously, they used `f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY` and `f.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY` respectively. This was changed to `cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY` and `df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY`, implying that `TAX_AMOUNT` is now expected to be directly on the `DIM_CONTRACT_FEE` and `DIM_DEED_FEE` tables (aliased as `cf` and `df` respectively) rather than on the `DIM_FEE` table (aliased as `f`). Also, the `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` condition was changed to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` (capitalization change).
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM**: Similar to the previous change, the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE's `COALESCE(SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * ccf.QUANTITY), 0)` was updated to `COALESCE(SUM(ccf.TAX_AMOUNT * ccf.QUANTITY), 0)`, implying a similar shift of `TAX_AMOUNT` from `DIM_FEE` to `DIM_CANCELLED_CONTRACT_FEE` for this commented section as well.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM**: The `WHERE` clauses for `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` were modified. `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` changed to `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT))`. This suggests a type casting issue or an explicit conversion to integer for `CONTRACT_ID` in subqueries.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM**: The hardcoded contract number filter in `base_contracts` was changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM**: The explicit `CAST(... AS INT)` was removed from the `WHERE` clauses for `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`. For `deed_fee_tax`, there's a syntax error with a missing opening parenthesis `WHERE df.CONTRACT_ID IN SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)`.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM**: The syntax error in the `deed_fee_tax` `WHERE` clause was corrected to `WHERE df.CONTRACT_ID IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)`.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM**: In `contract_tax_totals`, the line `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` was completely removed from the summation, and the preceding line was uncommented `//+`. This formally removes cancelled contract fee tax from the total tax calculation, aligning with the earlier commenting out of the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM**: The line `// COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax` was modified, changing the comment `//+` to `//`. This makes the commenting of the cancelled fee tax total more consistent.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM**: The line `//+` before `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax` was re-commented to `//+ // COALESCE...`, implying it was still being worked on or reconsidered.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM**: The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` filter in `base_contracts` was commented out, and the original date range filtering `(CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}' OR EXISTS (...))` was re-enabled. This suggests moving past specific contract debugging and back to general date-range data retrieval.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:32:48 PM**: No discernible change from the previous entry.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM**: All commented-out lines related to `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` (both the CTE and its usage in `contract_tax_totals`) were completely removed from the code, effectively streamlining the query by permanently excluding that calculation. Also, the `FROM` clause for the final `SELECT` statement was extended to explicitly include `LEFT JOIN item_counts ic` which was previously truncated in the logs.

2.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**: This file handles syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM**: The code includes a `dd($dealsBatch);` statement within the `syncPlotBoxData` method, which is a Laravel helper function to dump and die, effectively halting script execution for debugging purposes.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM**: The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was removed from the `syncPlotBoxData` method. This indicates that the debugging step was completed, and the full data sync process (including contact and deal processing, and location associations) is now intended to run.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM**: The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was re-introduced into the `syncPlotBoxData` method, again likely for debugging.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM**: The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was removed once more.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **January 21, 2026, 12:52 PM - 4:32 PM**: Focused, iterative changes on `Contact.php`, primarily within the SQL query of `getDataWithDateRange`, involving:
    *   Switching between date range filtering and hardcoded contract number filtering.
    *   Modifying how `TAX_AMOUNT` is sourced for fee calculations (from `DIM_FEE` to specific fee tables).
    *   Commenting out and later completely removing the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` calculation.
    *   Attempting and correcting SQL `CAST` syntax in subqueries.
*   **January 21, 2026, 12:54 PM** and **January 22, 2026, 11:19 AM - 11:25 AM**: Changes in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` reflect debugging cycles, with `dd($dealsBatch);` being added and removed.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Debugging via Hardcoded Filters**: In `Contact.php`, there's a clear pattern of temporarily replacing a dynamic date range filter with a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter, indicating a focus on testing or debugging a specific contract's data retrieval. This pattern is reversed once debugging is complete.
*   **Iterative SQL Refinement**: The SQL query within `getDataWithDateRange` in `Contact.php` underwent multiple small adjustments related to tax calculations (`f.TAX_AMOUNT` vs `cf.TAX_AMOUNT`, removal of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`) and subquery syntax (`CAST` removal). This suggests an iterative process of refining the data extraction logic.
*   **Debugging Flow Control in Services**: In `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, the repeated addition and removal of `dd($dealsBatch);` points to an active debugging session where the developer is inspecting the `$dealsBatch` variable at a specific point in the data synchronization flow. The pauses between these changes (e.g., from 1/21 12:54 PM to 1/22 11:19 AM) could indicate longer testing periods or context switching.
*   **Consistent File Scope**: All changes are concentrated on just two files, `Contact.php` and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, suggesting work on a specific feature or bug related to PlotBox contact and deal data processing and synchronization to HubSpot.
*   **Data Integration Focus**: Both files are integral to a data integration pipeline: `Contact.php` extracts and transforms data from a Snowflake warehouse, and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` orchestrates the synchronization of this data to HubSpot.
