# Activity Summary for 1/28/2026

## 9:20:21 AM
The following summarizes the code changes from the provided log:

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM**
    *   Initial state of the `getDataWithDateRange` method. The SQL query includes a `WHERE` clause to filter `DIM_CONTRACT` based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within the specified date range. It also includes a `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and a corresponding `LEFT JOIN` and `COALESCE` in the `contract_tax_totals` CTE and `SELECT` statement respectively. The final `SELECT` statement is truncated.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM**
    *   A significant change was made to the `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query. The date range filtering in the `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause was commented out, and a specific contract number filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` was added. The final `SELECT` statement remains truncated, but slightly less truncated than before, showing more of the `item_counts` aliases.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM**
    *   No functional changes observed in the provided snippet. The content is identical to the previous entry, including the commented-out date range and the hardcoded contract number filter. The truncation point is also identical.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 1:37:28 PM**
    *   No functional changes observed in the provided snippet. The content is identical to the previous entries, including the commented-out date range and the hardcoded contract number filter. The truncation point is also identical.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM**
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was commented out in the SQL query within the `getDataWithDateRange` method. Consequently, the `LEFT JOIN` for `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` and its `COALESCE` usage in the `contract_tax_totals` CTE were also commented out.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM**
    *   In the `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, the calculation `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` was changed to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` and `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` respectively. This implies a change in which column holds the `TAX_AMOUNT`. Also, the `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` was changed to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` (capital 'I').
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM**
    *   In the `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the now commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs, the reference for `TAX_AMOUNT` was consistently updated from `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` (or `ccf.TAX_AMOUNT`) to `f.TAX_AMOUNT` in the `SUM` calculation. This reverts the change from the previous timestamp for `contract_fee_tax` and `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`, and corrects `deed_fee_tax`. The case for 'Interest' in `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` remains capitalized.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM**
    *   Added explicit `CAST(... AS INT)` around the subqueries `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` within the `WHERE ... IN` clauses of `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM**
    *   The hardcoded contract number filter in `base_contracts` was changed from `645-110814` to `110814`.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:20:28 PM**
    *   Reverted the explicit `CAST(... AS INT)` from the `WHERE ... IN` clauses in `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs. The contract number filter remains `110814`.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM**
    *   The explicit `CAST(... AS INT)` around `SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts` was re-introduced for the `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs. However, there's a syntax error in the `deed_fee_tax` CTE's `WHERE` clause: `IN SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` is missing a parenthesis `(`.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM**
    *   The explicit `CAST(... AS INT)` was removed again from the `WHERE ... IN` clauses in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax`, effectively reverting the changes made at 4:23:56 PM. The syntax error in `deed_fee_tax` is therefore also implicitly resolved by this reversion.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM**
    *   A commented-out `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` was added to the `total_tax` calculation in the `contract_tax_totals` CTE, despite the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE itself being commented out. This seems to be an oversight or partial re-introduction.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM**
    *   The commented-out line `// COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax` in `contract_tax_totals` was adjusted; the `AS total_tax` part was moved up to the preceding line's `COALESCE` sum. This correctly assigns the alias to the combined sum, but the `ccft` part remains commented out, indicating no functional change related to cancelled fees.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM**
    *   The commented-out line `//+ // COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax` in `contract_tax_totals` was further condensed to `//+ COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax` by removing an extra newline and a redundant `//`. Functionally, still no change regarding cancelled fees.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM**
    *   The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` filter in `base_contracts` was commented out. The original date range filtering logic based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` and `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` was uncommented, restoring the intended date filtering functionality.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:32:48 PM**
    *   No functional changes observed in the provided snippet. The content is identical to the previous entry.
*   **Timestamp: 1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM**
    *   All commented-out lines related to `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` (the CTE, its `LEFT JOIN`, and its `COALESCE` in `contract_tax_totals`) were completely removed from the SQL query within the `getDataWithDateRange` method. This formally removes any consideration of cancelled fees from the total tax calculation.
    *   A significant addition was made to the main `SELECT` statement: a series of `LEFT JOIN` clauses for `deceased_contacts` (aliased as `dc`), `contract_writers` (aliased as `cw`), and `item_counts` (aliased as `ic`), linking them to `primary_contacts` (`pc`) and `dim_facility` (`df`). This completes the final part of the complex SQL query for data retrieval.

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM**
    *   The `syncPlotBoxData` method contains a `dd($dealsBatch)` call (Laravel's "dump and die" function) which would halt execution immediately after populating the batch arrays. This indicates active debugging. The file also includes extensive logging for errors and location association processing.
*   **Timestamp: 1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM**
    *   The `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging line was removed from the `syncPlotBoxData` method, indicating that the debugging step related to `dealsBatch` is complete and the code is intended to run through the `processContacts` method.
*   **Timestamp: 1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM**
    *   The `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging line was re-introduced into the `syncPlotBoxData` method. This suggests a re-initiation of debugging or a need to re-verify the contents of `$dealsBatch`.
*   **Timestamp: 1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM**
    *   No functional changes observed in the provided snippet. The content is identical to the previous entry, including the `dd($dealsBatch)` call.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Frequent Modifications to `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`:** This file was heavily iterated upon throughout the log, particularly its `getDataWithDateRange` method and the embedded SQL query.
*   **SQL Query Refinements:**
    *   Repeated commenting/uncommenting of the date range filter in the `base_contracts` CTE, often replaced with a hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` for testing.
    *   Consistent changes around the calculation of `contract_tax_totals`, specifically the inclusion/exclusion/commenting of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` and the `TAX_AMOUNT` column reference.
    *   Attempts to `CAST` `CONTRACT_ID` to `INT` in subqueries, followed by reversion, indicating experimentation with data types or query optimization.
    *   The final major change to this file completes the complex `SELECT` statement by adding several `LEFT JOIN`s, indicating the query was being progressively built or refined.
*   **Debugging in `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` call appearing and disappearing multiple times suggests active debugging related to how deal data is mapped and batched before further processing.
*   **HubSpot Integration Logic:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService` consistently shows an architecture for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot, involving mappers, repositories, and specific HubSpot services for contacts, deals, and locations, including complex association logic between these entities. Error logging is also a prominent feature.
*   **`WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` Schema:** All SQL queries consistently reference tables within the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` schema (e.g., `DIM_CONTRACT`, `DIM_CONTACT`, `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`).
*   **`COALESCE` Usage:** Frequent use of `COALESCE` in SQL queries to handle potential `NULL` values and provide default `0` values for sums or prices.
*   **Date Formatting:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method expects `Y-m-d` date format for input.

## 10:20:31 AM
The changes primarily focus on two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**

This file, representing a `Contact` Eloquent model for PlotBox data, underwent numerous changes between 1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM and 1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM. The core modifications are concentrated within the `getDataWithDateRange` static method, which executes a complex SQL query against a Snowflake data warehouse.

Key changes and their timestamps:

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM:**
    *   A hardcoded `WHERE DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` clause was introduced in the `base_contracts` CTE.
    *   The original date range filter (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN ...` and the `EXISTS` subquery for `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER` and `DIM_CONTACT` updates) was commented out. This suggests a shift from date-range based filtering to targeting a specific contract for testing or debugging.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM:** No functional changes, likely a save operation.

*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:**
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE (Common Table Expression) was entirely commented out.
    *   Consequently, the reference to `ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total` was also commented out in the `contract_tax_totals` CTE, reducing the total tax calculation to only contract and deed fees.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:**
    *   In the `contract_fee_tax` CTE, the `SUM` calculation was changed from `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)`. This is a significant change, implying that the `TAX_AMOUNT` is now directly available on `DIM_CONTRACT_FEE` (`cf`) instead of `DIM_FEE` (`f`).
    *   Similarly, in the `deed_fee_tax` CTE, the `SUM` calculation changed from `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)`. Note that `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` here seems like a typo and should likely be `df.TAX_AMOUNT` based on the table alias (`df`) used for `DIM_DEED_FEE`. This could be a bug.
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was commented out, and its reference removed from `contract_tax_totals`, which aligns with the previous change at 3:57:10 PM.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM:**
    *   The typo in `deed_fee_tax` was corrected: `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` was changed to `SUM(df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)`.
    *   The case of `'interest'` in `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` was changed to `'Interest'`.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:**
    *   In `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs, the `WHERE ... IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` clause was modified to include a `CAST(... AS INT)` around the subquery: `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT))`. This explicitly casts the contract IDs to integers.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM:** The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` in `base_contracts` was changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM:**
    *   A syntax error was introduced in `deed_fee_tax` where `WHERE df.CONTRACT_ID IN SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` is missing a parenthesis around the `SELECT` statement: `WHERE df.CONTRACT_ID IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)`. This likely caused a syntax error.
    *   Similarly, in `contract_fee_tax` and the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`, the `CAST` operation was incorrectly applied to the entire subquery `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` instead of just the column `CONTRACT_ID`. The correct form should probably be `(SELECT CAST(CONTRACT_ID AS INT) FROM base_contracts)`.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM:** The `CAST(... AS INT)` modifications in the `WHERE IN` clauses were reverted. The subqueries now read `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)`. The missing parenthesis in `deed_fee_tax` was fixed.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM:** In `contract_tax_totals`, the `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` part was uncommented but renamed to `COALESCE(cft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)`. This looks like a bug, as `cft` is the alias for `contract_fee_tax` and `cancelled_fee_tax_total` should come from `ccft`. The `LEFT JOIN cancelled_contract_fee_tax ccft` line itself remains commented.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM:** The `COALESCE(cft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` in `contract_tax_totals` was commented out again.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM:** In `contract_tax_totals`, the line `//+ // COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax` was further commented, specifically the `+` operator, ensuring it's not included.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** The hardcoded `WHERE DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` filter was commented out, and the original date range filter (`(CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN ... OR EXISTS (...))`) was reactivated. This restores the method's intended functionality of filtering by a date range.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:32:48 PM:** No functional changes, likely a save operation.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM:**
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its corresponding `LEFT JOIN` in `contract_tax_totals` were completely removed, rather than just commented out. This definitively removes the cancelled fee tax from the total tax calculation.
    *   The `SELECT` statement at the very end of the `getDataWithDateRange` method was expanded significantly, adding several `LEFT JOIN` clauses: `LEFT JOIN item_counts ic ON pc.CONTRACT_ID = ic.CONTRACT_ID`, `LEFT JOIN WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_FACILITY df ON pc.FACILITY_ID = df.FACILITY_ID`, `LEFT JOIN contract_net_prices cnp ON pc.CONTRACT_ID = cnp.CONTRACT_ID`. This completes the SQL query to retrieve all the defined fields.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:43 AM:** No functional changes, likely a save operation.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:25:33 AM:** No functional changes, likely a save operation.

*   **1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM:** No functional changes, likely a save operation.

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**

This file handles the synchronization of PlotBox data to HubSpot. It saw only two changes, closely spaced.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** A `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was added after populating the batch arrays (`primaryContactBatch`, `deceasedContactBatch`, `dealsBatch`, `locationAssociations`) within the `syncPlotBoxData` method. `dd()` is a Laravel helper function for "dump and die," meaning it will stop script execution and display the contents of the variable. This indicates a debugging step to inspect the `dealsBatch` data before further processing.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement that was added previously was removed. This suggests the debugging task was completed.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was re-added. This indicates the debugging process was resumed or there was a need to re-verify the `dealsBatch` contents.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was removed again.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging Activities:** The most prominent pattern is the repeated addition and removal of `dd($dealsBatch);` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, indicating an active debugging phase, likely related to the `dealsBatch` data.
*   **SQL Query Iteration:** In `Contact.php`, there's a highly iterative process of refining and debugging a large SQL query within the `getDataWithDateRange` method. This includes:
    *   **Filtering Strategy Changes:** Shifting from a flexible date range filter to a hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` and then back again. This points to a cycle of focused testing/debugging followed by restoration of general functionality.
    *   **Tax Calculation Refinements:** Repeated commenting out, uncommenting, and subtle changes (and errors) in how contract fees, deed fees, and cancelled contract fees contribute to the total tax, particularly around the source of `TAX_AMOUNT` and the inclusion/exclusion of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`.
    *   **SQL Syntax/Type Casting Adjustments:** Brief attempts to add `CAST(... AS INT)` to subqueries, followed by their removal or correction, indicating a search for robust SQL syntax or type compatibility.
    *   **Query Completion:** The final, significant change to `Contact.php` involves completing the final `SELECT` statement with all necessary `LEFT JOIN`s, suggesting the core query logic was being built and verified piece by piece.
*   **Timestamp Proximity:** Many changes to `Contact.php` occurred in rapid succession, especially between 4:05 PM and 4:31 PM on 1/21/2026, and then again around 11:24 AM on 1/22/2026, highlighting an intense period of active development and debugging.
