The following summarizes the code changes from the provided log:

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM**
    *   Initial state of the `getDataWithDateRange` method. The SQL query includes a `WHERE` clause to filter `DIM_CONTRACT` based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within the specified date range. It also includes a `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and a corresponding `LEFT JOIN` and `COALESCE` in the `contract_tax_totals` CTE and `SELECT` statement respectively. The final `SELECT` statement is truncated.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM**
    *   A significant change was made to the `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query. The date range filtering in the `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause was commented out, and a specific contract number filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` was added. The final `SELECT` statement remains truncated, but slightly less truncated than before, showing more of the `item_counts` aliases.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM**
    *   No functional changes observed in the provided snippet. The content is identical to the previous entry, including the commented-out date range and the hardcoded contract number filter. The truncation point is also identical.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 1:37:28 PM**
    *   No functional changes observed in the provided snippet. The content is identical to the previous entries, including the commented-out date range and the hardcoded contract number filter. The truncation point is also identical.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM**
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was commented out in the SQL query within the `getDataWithDateRange` method. Consequently, the `LEFT JOIN` for `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` and its `COALESCE` usage in the `contract_tax_totals` CTE were also commented out.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM**
    *   In the `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, the calculation `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` was changed to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` and `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` respectively. This implies a change in which column holds the `TAX_AMOUNT`. Also, the `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` was changed to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` (capital 'I').
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM**
    *   In the `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the now commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs, the reference for `TAX_AMOUNT` was consistently updated from `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` (or `ccf.TAX_AMOUNT`) to `f.TAX_AMOUNT` in the `SUM` calculation. This reverts the change from the previous timestamp for `contract_fee_tax` and `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`, and corrects `deed_fee_tax`. The case for 'Interest' in `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` remains capitalized.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM**
    *   Added explicit `CAST(... AS INT)` around the subqueries `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` within the `WHERE ... IN` clauses of `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM**
    *   The hardcoded contract number filter in `base_contracts` was changed from `645-110814` to `110814`.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:20:28 PM**
    *   Reverted the explicit `CAST(... AS INT)` from the `WHERE ... IN` clauses in `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs. The contract number filter remains `110814`.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM**
    *   The explicit `CAST(... AS INT)` around `SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts` was re-introduced for the `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs. However, there's a syntax error in the `deed_fee_tax` CTE's `WHERE` clause: `IN SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` is missing a parenthesis `(`.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM**
    *   The explicit `CAST(... AS INT)` was removed again from the `WHERE ... IN` clauses in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax`, effectively reverting the changes made at 4:23:56 PM. The syntax error in `deed_fee_tax` is therefore also implicitly resolved by this reversion.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM**
    *   A commented-out `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` was added to the `total_tax` calculation in the `contract_tax_totals` CTE, despite the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE itself being commented out. This seems to be an oversight or partial re-introduction.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM**
    *   The commented-out line `// COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax` in `contract_tax_totals` was adjusted; the `AS total_tax` part was moved up to the preceding line's `COALESCE` sum. This correctly assigns the alias to the combined sum, but the `ccft` part remains commented out, indicating no functional change related to cancelled fees.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM**
    *   The commented-out line `//+ // COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax` in `contract_tax_totals` was further condensed to `//+ COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax` by removing an extra newline and a redundant `//`. Functionally, still no change regarding cancelled fees.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM**
    *   The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` filter in `base_contracts` was commented out. The original date range filtering logic based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` and `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` was uncommented, restoring the intended date filtering functionality.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:32:48 PM**
    *   No functional changes observed in the provided snippet. The content is identical to the previous entry.
*   **Timestamp: 1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM**
    *   All commented-out lines related to `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` (the CTE, its `LEFT JOIN`, and its `COALESCE` in `contract_tax_totals`) were completely removed from the SQL query within the `getDataWithDateRange` method. This formally removes any consideration of cancelled fees from the total tax calculation.
    *   A significant addition was made to the main `SELECT` statement: a series of `LEFT JOIN` clauses for `deceased_contacts` (aliased as `dc`), `contract_writers` (aliased as `cw`), and `item_counts` (aliased as `ic`), linking them to `primary_contacts` (`pc`) and `dim_facility` (`df`). This completes the final part of the complex SQL query for data retrieval.

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM**
    *   The `syncPlotBoxData` method contains a `dd($dealsBatch)` call (Laravel's "dump and die" function) which would halt execution immediately after populating the batch arrays. This indicates active debugging. The file also includes extensive logging for errors and location association processing.
*   **Timestamp: 1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM**
    *   The `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging line was removed from the `syncPlotBoxData` method, indicating that the debugging step related to `dealsBatch` is complete and the code is intended to run through the `processContacts` method.
*   **Timestamp: 1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM**
    *   The `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging line was re-introduced into the `syncPlotBoxData` method. This suggests a re-initiation of debugging or a need to re-verify the contents of `$dealsBatch`.
*   **Timestamp: 1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM**
    *   No functional changes observed in the provided snippet. The content is identical to the previous entry, including the `dd($dealsBatch)` call.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Frequent Modifications to `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`:** This file was heavily iterated upon throughout the log, particularly its `getDataWithDateRange` method and the embedded SQL query.
*   **SQL Query Refinements:**
    *   Repeated commenting/uncommenting of the date range filter in the `base_contracts` CTE, often replaced with a hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` for testing.
    *   Consistent changes around the calculation of `contract_tax_totals`, specifically the inclusion/exclusion/commenting of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` and the `TAX_AMOUNT` column reference.
    *   Attempts to `CAST` `CONTRACT_ID` to `INT` in subqueries, followed by reversion, indicating experimentation with data types or query optimization.
    *   The final major change to this file completes the complex `SELECT` statement by adding several `LEFT JOIN`s, indicating the query was being progressively built or refined.
*   **Debugging in `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` call appearing and disappearing multiple times suggests active debugging related to how deal data is mapped and batched before further processing.
*   **HubSpot Integration Logic:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService` consistently shows an architecture for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot, involving mappers, repositories, and specific HubSpot services for contacts, deals, and locations, including complex association logic between these entities. Error logging is also a prominent feature.
*   **`WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` Schema:** All SQL queries consistently reference tables within the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` schema (e.g., `DIM_CONTRACT`, `DIM_CONTACT`, `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`).
*   **`COALESCE` Usage:** Frequent use of `COALESCE` in SQL queries to handle potential `NULL` values and provide default `0` values for sums or prices.
*   **Date Formatting:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method expects `Y-m-d` date format for input.
