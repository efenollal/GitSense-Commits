# Activity Summary for 1/28/2026

## 9:20:21 AM
The following summarizes the code changes from the provided log:

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM**
    *   Initial state of the `getDataWithDateRange` method. The SQL query includes a `WHERE` clause to filter `DIM_CONTRACT` based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within the specified date range. It also includes a `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and a corresponding `LEFT JOIN` and `COALESCE` in the `contract_tax_totals` CTE and `SELECT` statement respectively. The final `SELECT` statement is truncated.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM**
    *   A significant change was made to the `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query. The date range filtering in the `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause was commented out, and a specific contract number filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` was added. The final `SELECT` statement remains truncated, but slightly less truncated than before, showing more of the `item_counts` aliases.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM**
    *   No functional changes observed in the provided snippet. The content is identical to the previous entry, including the commented-out date range and the hardcoded contract number filter. The truncation point is also identical.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 1:37:28 PM**
    *   No functional changes observed in the provided snippet. The content is identical to the previous entries, including the commented-out date range and the hardcoded contract number filter. The truncation point is also identical.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM**
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was commented out in the SQL query within the `getDataWithDateRange` method. Consequently, the `LEFT JOIN` for `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` and its `COALESCE` usage in the `contract_tax_totals` CTE were also commented out.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM**
    *   In the `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, the calculation `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` was changed to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` and `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` respectively. This implies a change in which column holds the `TAX_AMOUNT`. Also, the `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` was changed to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` (capital 'I').
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM**
    *   In the `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the now commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs, the reference for `TAX_AMOUNT` was consistently updated from `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` (or `ccf.TAX_AMOUNT`) to `f.TAX_AMOUNT` in the `SUM` calculation. This reverts the change from the previous timestamp for `contract_fee_tax` and `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`, and corrects `deed_fee_tax`. The case for 'Interest' in `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` remains capitalized.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM**
    *   Added explicit `CAST(... AS INT)` around the subqueries `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` within the `WHERE ... IN` clauses of `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM**
    *   The hardcoded contract number filter in `base_contracts` was changed from `645-110814` to `110814`.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:20:28 PM**
    *   Reverted the explicit `CAST(... AS INT)` from the `WHERE ... IN` clauses in `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs. The contract number filter remains `110814`.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM**
    *   The explicit `CAST(... AS INT)` around `SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts` was re-introduced for the `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs. However, there's a syntax error in the `deed_fee_tax` CTE's `WHERE` clause: `IN SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` is missing a parenthesis `(`.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM**
    *   The explicit `CAST(... AS INT)` was removed again from the `WHERE ... IN` clauses in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax`, effectively reverting the changes made at 4:23:56 PM. The syntax error in `deed_fee_tax` is therefore also implicitly resolved by this reversion.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM**
    *   A commented-out `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` was added to the `total_tax` calculation in the `contract_tax_totals` CTE, despite the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE itself being commented out. This seems to be an oversight or partial re-introduction.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM**
    *   The commented-out line `// COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax` in `contract_tax_totals` was adjusted; the `AS total_tax` part was moved up to the preceding line's `COALESCE` sum. This correctly assigns the alias to the combined sum, but the `ccft` part remains commented out, indicating no functional change related to cancelled fees.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM**
    *   The commented-out line `//+ // COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax` in `contract_tax_totals` was further condensed to `//+ COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax` by removing an extra newline and a redundant `//`. Functionally, still no change regarding cancelled fees.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM**
    *   The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` filter in `base_contracts` was commented out. The original date range filtering logic based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` and `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` was uncommented, restoring the intended date filtering functionality.
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 4:32:48 PM**
    *   No functional changes observed in the provided snippet. The content is identical to the previous entry.
*   **Timestamp: 1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM**
    *   All commented-out lines related to `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` (the CTE, its `LEFT JOIN`, and its `COALESCE` in `contract_tax_totals`) were completely removed from the SQL query within the `getDataWithDateRange` method. This formally removes any consideration of cancelled fees from the total tax calculation.
    *   A significant addition was made to the main `SELECT` statement: a series of `LEFT JOIN` clauses for `deceased_contacts` (aliased as `dc`), `contract_writers` (aliased as `cw`), and `item_counts` (aliased as `ic`), linking them to `primary_contacts` (`pc`) and `dim_facility` (`df`). This completes the final part of the complex SQL query for data retrieval.

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
*   **Timestamp: 1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM**
    *   The `syncPlotBoxData` method contains a `dd($dealsBatch)` call (Laravel's "dump and die" function) which would halt execution immediately after populating the batch arrays. This indicates active debugging. The file also includes extensive logging for errors and location association processing.
*   **Timestamp: 1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM**
    *   The `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging line was removed from the `syncPlotBoxData` method, indicating that the debugging step related to `dealsBatch` is complete and the code is intended to run through the `processContacts` method.
*   **Timestamp: 1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM**
    *   The `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging line was re-introduced into the `syncPlotBoxData` method. This suggests a re-initiation of debugging or a need to re-verify the contents of `$dealsBatch`.
*   **Timestamp: 1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM**
    *   No functional changes observed in the provided snippet. The content is identical to the previous entry, including the `dd($dealsBatch)` call.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Frequent Modifications to `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`:** This file was heavily iterated upon throughout the log, particularly its `getDataWithDateRange` method and the embedded SQL query.
*   **SQL Query Refinements:**
    *   Repeated commenting/uncommenting of the date range filter in the `base_contracts` CTE, often replaced with a hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` for testing.
    *   Consistent changes around the calculation of `contract_tax_totals`, specifically the inclusion/exclusion/commenting of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` and the `TAX_AMOUNT` column reference.
    *   Attempts to `CAST` `CONTRACT_ID` to `INT` in subqueries, followed by reversion, indicating experimentation with data types or query optimization.
    *   The final major change to this file completes the complex `SELECT` statement by adding several `LEFT JOIN`s, indicating the query was being progressively built or refined.
*   **Debugging in `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` call appearing and disappearing multiple times suggests active debugging related to how deal data is mapped and batched before further processing.
*   **HubSpot Integration Logic:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService` consistently shows an architecture for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot, involving mappers, repositories, and specific HubSpot services for contacts, deals, and locations, including complex association logic between these entities. Error logging is also a prominent feature.
*   **`WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` Schema:** All SQL queries consistently reference tables within the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` schema (e.g., `DIM_CONTRACT`, `DIM_CONTACT`, `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`).
*   **`COALESCE` Usage:** Frequent use of `COALESCE` in SQL queries to handle potential `NULL` values and provide default `0` values for sums or prices.
*   **Date Formatting:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method expects `Y-m-d` date format for input.

## 10:20:31 AM
The changes primarily focus on two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**

This file, representing a `Contact` Eloquent model for PlotBox data, underwent numerous changes between 1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM and 1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM. The core modifications are concentrated within the `getDataWithDateRange` static method, which executes a complex SQL query against a Snowflake data warehouse.

Key changes and their timestamps:

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM:**
    *   A hardcoded `WHERE DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` clause was introduced in the `base_contracts` CTE.
    *   The original date range filter (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN ...` and the `EXISTS` subquery for `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER` and `DIM_CONTACT` updates) was commented out. This suggests a shift from date-range based filtering to targeting a specific contract for testing or debugging.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM:** No functional changes, likely a save operation.

*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:**
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE (Common Table Expression) was entirely commented out.
    *   Consequently, the reference to `ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total` was also commented out in the `contract_tax_totals` CTE, reducing the total tax calculation to only contract and deed fees.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:**
    *   In the `contract_fee_tax` CTE, the `SUM` calculation was changed from `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)`. This is a significant change, implying that the `TAX_AMOUNT` is now directly available on `DIM_CONTRACT_FEE` (`cf`) instead of `DIM_FEE` (`f`).
    *   Similarly, in the `deed_fee_tax` CTE, the `SUM` calculation changed from `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)`. Note that `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` here seems like a typo and should likely be `df.TAX_AMOUNT` based on the table alias (`df`) used for `DIM_DEED_FEE`. This could be a bug.
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was commented out, and its reference removed from `contract_tax_totals`, which aligns with the previous change at 3:57:10 PM.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM:**
    *   The typo in `deed_fee_tax` was corrected: `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` was changed to `SUM(df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)`.
    *   The case of `'interest'` in `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` was changed to `'Interest'`.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:**
    *   In `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs, the `WHERE ... IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` clause was modified to include a `CAST(... AS INT)` around the subquery: `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT))`. This explicitly casts the contract IDs to integers.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM:** The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` in `base_contracts` was changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM:**
    *   A syntax error was introduced in `deed_fee_tax` where `WHERE df.CONTRACT_ID IN SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` is missing a parenthesis around the `SELECT` statement: `WHERE df.CONTRACT_ID IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)`. This likely caused a syntax error.
    *   Similarly, in `contract_fee_tax` and the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`, the `CAST` operation was incorrectly applied to the entire subquery `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` instead of just the column `CONTRACT_ID`. The correct form should probably be `(SELECT CAST(CONTRACT_ID AS INT) FROM base_contracts)`.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM:** The `CAST(... AS INT)` modifications in the `WHERE IN` clauses were reverted. The subqueries now read `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)`. The missing parenthesis in `deed_fee_tax` was fixed.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM:** In `contract_tax_totals`, the `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` part was uncommented but renamed to `COALESCE(cft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)`. This looks like a bug, as `cft` is the alias for `contract_fee_tax` and `cancelled_fee_tax_total` should come from `ccft`. The `LEFT JOIN cancelled_contract_fee_tax ccft` line itself remains commented.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM:** The `COALESCE(cft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` in `contract_tax_totals` was commented out again.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM:** In `contract_tax_totals`, the line `//+ // COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax` was further commented, specifically the `+` operator, ensuring it's not included.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** The hardcoded `WHERE DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` filter was commented out, and the original date range filter (`(CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN ... OR EXISTS (...))`) was reactivated. This restores the method's intended functionality of filtering by a date range.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:32:48 PM:** No functional changes, likely a save operation.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM:**
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its corresponding `LEFT JOIN` in `contract_tax_totals` were completely removed, rather than just commented out. This definitively removes the cancelled fee tax from the total tax calculation.
    *   The `SELECT` statement at the very end of the `getDataWithDateRange` method was expanded significantly, adding several `LEFT JOIN` clauses: `LEFT JOIN item_counts ic ON pc.CONTRACT_ID = ic.CONTRACT_ID`, `LEFT JOIN WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_FACILITY df ON pc.FACILITY_ID = df.FACILITY_ID`, `LEFT JOIN contract_net_prices cnp ON pc.CONTRACT_ID = cnp.CONTRACT_ID`. This completes the SQL query to retrieve all the defined fields.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:43 AM:** No functional changes, likely a save operation.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:25:33 AM:** No functional changes, likely a save operation.

*   **1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM:** No functional changes, likely a save operation.

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**

This file handles the synchronization of PlotBox data to HubSpot. It saw only two changes, closely spaced.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** A `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was added after populating the batch arrays (`primaryContactBatch`, `deceasedContactBatch`, `dealsBatch`, `locationAssociations`) within the `syncPlotBoxData` method. `dd()` is a Laravel helper function for "dump and die," meaning it will stop script execution and display the contents of the variable. This indicates a debugging step to inspect the `dealsBatch` data before further processing.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement that was added previously was removed. This suggests the debugging task was completed.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was re-added. This indicates the debugging process was resumed or there was a need to re-verify the `dealsBatch` contents.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was removed again.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging Activities:** The most prominent pattern is the repeated addition and removal of `dd($dealsBatch);` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, indicating an active debugging phase, likely related to the `dealsBatch` data.
*   **SQL Query Iteration:** In `Contact.php`, there's a highly iterative process of refining and debugging a large SQL query within the `getDataWithDateRange` method. This includes:
    *   **Filtering Strategy Changes:** Shifting from a flexible date range filter to a hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` and then back again. This points to a cycle of focused testing/debugging followed by restoration of general functionality.
    *   **Tax Calculation Refinements:** Repeated commenting out, uncommenting, and subtle changes (and errors) in how contract fees, deed fees, and cancelled contract fees contribute to the total tax, particularly around the source of `TAX_AMOUNT` and the inclusion/exclusion of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`.
    *   **SQL Syntax/Type Casting Adjustments:** Brief attempts to add `CAST(... AS INT)` to subqueries, followed by their removal or correction, indicating a search for robust SQL syntax or type compatibility.
    *   **Query Completion:** The final, significant change to `Contact.php` involves completing the final `SELECT` statement with all necessary `LEFT JOIN`s, suggesting the core query logic was being built and verified piece by piece.
*   **Timestamp Proximity:** Many changes to `Contact.php` occurred in rapid succession, especially between 4:05 PM and 4:31 PM on 1/21/2026, and then again around 11:24 AM on 1/22/2026, highlighting an intense period of active development and debugging.

## 12:20:33 PM
The changes revolve around two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

### File-specific updates:

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**

This file, a Laravel Eloquent model for `Contact` within the `PlotBox` namespace, consistently defines database connection (`snowflake`), table (`PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT`), primary key (`CONTACT_KEY`), and fillable attributes. The core of the changes is within the `getDataWithDateRange` static method, which executes a complex SQL query to retrieve contract and contact data.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM**: Initial state (or a significant baseline). The `WHERE` clause in the `base_contracts` CTE filters by `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within a given date range (`$fromDate` and `$toDate`). It also includes a `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and uses `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` in `contract_tax_totals`.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM** and **1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM**: A specific filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` is introduced in the `base_contracts` CTE, effectively hardcoding the contract number. The original date range filter is commented out. No other significant changes in these timestamps. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its use remain present.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM**: The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE is completely commented out. Consequently, the reference to `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` is also commented out within the `contract_tax_totals` CTE.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM**: The calculation for `contract_fee_tax_total` and `deed_fee_tax_total` is changed within their respective CTEs. Specifically, `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` becomes `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` and `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` becomes `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)`. This is a likely bug introduced as `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` and `ccf.TAX_AMOUNT` are used instead of `f.TAX_AMOUNT` in the fee-related CTEs. The `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` filter now uses `'Interest'` (capital I) in the `contract_fee_tax` CTE. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remains commented out.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM**: Corrects the `TAX_AMOUNT` source in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs from `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` and `df.TAX_AMOUNT` back to `f.TAX_AMOUNT`. The `'interest'` to `'Interest'` casing change in the `contract_fee_tax` CTE is retained.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM**: Introduces `CAST(... AS INT)` around `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` subqueries within the `WHERE` clauses of `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM**: Modifies the hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter in `base_contracts` from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM**: Reverts the `CAST(... AS INT)` change in the `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, returning to `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)`. There's a syntax error in `deed_fee_tax` where `IN SELECT` is present without a parenthesis after `IN`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM**: Corrects the syntax error in `deed_fee_tax` to `IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)`. The `CAST(... AS INT)` is removed from all `CONTRACT_ID IN (SELECT ...)` subqueries.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM**: Minor correction in `contract_tax_totals`: `COALESCE(cft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` is incorrectly added to `total_tax` calculation, even though the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE is commented out, which would lead to an undefined variable `ccft`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM**: Corrects the `contract_tax_totals` CTE by commenting out `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)`, aligning it with the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM**: Adds a comment to the `total_tax` calculation line, indicating the `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` part is also commented out. Functionally identical to the previous state.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM**: The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` filter in the `base_contracts` CTE is commented out, restoring the original date range filter (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN ... OR EXISTS ...`).
*   **1/21/2026, 4:32:48 PM**: Adds missing `LEFT JOIN item_counts ic` clause at the very end of the main `SELECT` statement in `getDataWithDateRange`. This was an incomplete line in previous logs.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM**: Completes the final `LEFT JOIN` clauses in the main `SELECT` statement, joining `item_counts` and `DIM_FACILITY`. This completes the query structure.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**

This file is a service responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM**: Contains a `dd($dealsBatch);` statement within the `syncPlotBoxData` method, which is typically used for debugging and halts script execution.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM**: The `dd($dealsBatch);` debugging statement is removed from `syncPlotBoxData`. This indicates the debugging step was completed, and the code is now intended for full execution.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM**: Reintroduces the `dd($dealsBatch);` debugging statement within `syncPlotBoxData`, reverting the previous change.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM**: Removes the `dd($dealsBatch);` debugging statement again, indicating a back-and-forth debugging effort.

### Timestamps of significant changes:

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM**: Initial structure of the `getDataWithDateRange` query.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM**: Introduction of a hardcoded contract number filter for testing/debugging purposes.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM**: Removal (commenting out) of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` logic.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM**: Introduction of a bug in `TAX_AMOUNT` calculation and a casing change for 'Interest'.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM**: Correction of the `TAX_AMOUNT` bug.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM** to **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM**: Iterative attempts and corrections related to `CAST(... AS INT)` and syntax errors in subqueries.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM** to **1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM**: Iterative corrections related to removing the commented `cancelled_fee_tax_total` reference from `contract_tax_totals`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM**: Reinstatement of the original date range filter, removing the hardcoded contract number.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:32:48 PM** and **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM**: Completion of the final `LEFT JOIN` clauses in the main `SELECT`.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM**, **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM**, **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM**, **1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM**: Frequent additions and removals of a `dd($dealsBatch);` debugging statement in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

### Patterns or recurring elements:

*   **Debugging cycle in `Contact.php`**: There's a clear pattern of introducing specific filters (`CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'`, then `'110814'`) and commenting out date-based filters, then reverting them. This suggests active debugging or testing of the SQL query with specific data.
*   **SQL query refinement**: Several changes in `Contact.php` involve iterative refinement of the complex SQL query, specifically around tax calculations (`f.TAX_AMOUNT` vs. `cf.TAX_AMOUNT`), `CAST` operations, and handling commented-out CTEs. This indicates an ongoing process of optimizing or correcting the data retrieval logic.
*   **Incomplete code at end of log entry**: Many log entries for `Contact.php` end abruptly with an incomplete line of code (e.g., `COALESCE(ic.other_services_owned, 0)`, `COALESCE(ic.mausoleum_owned,`). This might be due to the log truncation or the changes being partial snapshots. However, the final `Contact.php` entry (1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM) shows the completion of the `LEFT JOIN` clauses, suggesting resolution of a multi-line change.
*   **`dd()` for debugging in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**: The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` file shows a repeated pattern of adding and removing `dd($dealsBatch);` statements, indicating intermittent debugging sessions to inspect the `$dealsBatch` variable. This pattern occurs across two distinct days, suggesting a prolonged or interrupted debugging process.
*   **Consistency in core model structure**: Despite the frequent changes to the SQL query within `getDataWithDateRange`, the basic structure of the `Contact` Eloquent model (connection, table, primary key, fillable attributes, relationships) remains unchanged across all logs.

## 1:20:32 PM
The following summarizes the key changes from the provided log:

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM**: Initial state of the `getDataWithDateRange` method within the `Contact` model. It contains a complex SQL query joining multiple `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` tables (`DIM_CONTRACT`, `DIM_PAYMENT_SCHEDULE`, `DIM_CONTRACT_FEE`, `DIM_DEED_FEE`, `DIM_CANCELLED_CONTRACT_FEE`, `DIM_CONTRACT_WRITER`, `DIM_SYSTEM_USER`, `DIM_CONTRACT_ITEM`, `DIM_FEE`, `DIM_FEE_CATEGORY`, `DIM_FACILITY`) to gather comprehensive contract and contact information, including primary and deceased contacts, sales details, and item counts (e.g., caskets, cremation products). The query initially filters by `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within a specified date range. A `contractStatusFilter` is conditionally applied for production environments.
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM**: The date range filter in the `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause is commented out. A hardcoded filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` is introduced, effectively limiting the data to a single contract for testing or debugging purposes. The last few lines of the `SELECT` statement in the final query are truncated in the provided log.
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM**: No functional changes, but the truncation of the SQL query's final `SELECT` statement is still present. The change log entry might indicate a saving action rather than a code modification. Also, the `COALESCE(cnp.net_price, pc.TOTAL_CASH_PRICE, 0)` in the final `SELECT` becomes `COALESCE(cnp.net_price, 0)`.
    *   **1/21/2026, 1:37:28 PM**: No apparent functional changes; likely a save operation. The SQL query remains focused on `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` with the date range commented out.
    *   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM**: The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its corresponding `LEFT JOIN` in `contract_tax_totals` are commented out. The truncation of the SQL query's final `SELECT` statement persists.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM**: In `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, the calculation of `contract_fee_tax_total` and `deed_fee_tax_total` is changed from `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` and `SUM(df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` respectively. This implies a change in which table the `TAX_AMOUNT` is being sourced from (previously `f.TAX_AMOUNT` (DIM_FEE), now `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` (DIM_CONTRACT_FEE) or `df.TAX_AMOUNT` (DIM_DEED_FEE)). The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remains commented out.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM**: The `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` condition is changed to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` in `contract_fee_tax` CTE (capitalization change). The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE comments are slightly altered, and the `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` in `contract_tax_totals` is now also commented out (previously it was included even if the CTE was commented).
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM**: In `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs, the `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` clause is changed to `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT))`. This explicitly casts the subquery result to an integer. The hardcoded contract number filter in `base_contracts` is changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM**: Only the hardcoded contract number filter in `base_contracts` is changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`. This might indicate a small test value adjustment.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:20:28 PM**: No visible functional changes; likely a save operation. The `CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` syntax is maintained.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM**: The `CAST` operation for subqueries `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` is removed, restoring the `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` form, but with a syntax error in `deed_fee_tax` (missing opening parenthesis for `SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)`).
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM**: The `CAST` operation is completely removed from all `WHERE ... IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` clauses, and the syntax error from the previous commit is fixed.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM**: In `contract_tax_totals`, the `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` is added back to the sum, but the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE itself remains commented out. This would lead to an undefined variable error if the CTE was intended to be active.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM**: The `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` is removed from `contract_tax_totals` calculation again, commenting it out. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remains commented out.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM**: No functional changes in the `getDataWithDateRange` method; likely a save operation.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM**: The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` filter in `base_contracts` is commented out, and the original date range filter (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN ...`) is reinstated. This restores the method to its intended functionality of querying data within a date range.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:32:48 PM**: No apparent functional changes to the PHP or SQL code in the `getDataWithDateRange` method. However, the final `SELECT` statement is significantly expanded and completed, including all `COALESCE` statements for the `item_counts` and a series of `LEFT JOIN` clauses (to `deceased_contacts`, `contract_writers`, `item_counts`, and `contract_net_prices`) to combine all derived CTE results. This completes the full SQL query structure.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM**: Initial commit of the `PlotBoxHubSpotService` class. This service is responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot. It initializes various HubSpot service dependencies (Contact, Deal, Location), retrieves PlotBox data via `hubSpotRepository->getDataForCrmSync()`, maps it to CRM format using `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`, and then batches primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals. A `dd($dealsBatch)` (dump and die) statement is present at the end of the `syncPlotBoxData` method, indicating a debugging stage. The `processContacts` method is also defined, handling contact search, creation/update, merging, and associations with deals and locations.
    *   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM**: The `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging statement is removed from the `syncPlotBoxData` method, allowing the `processContacts` method to execute. This indicates a progression from debugging to enabling the full sync logic.
    *   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM**: The `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging statement is reintroduced in the `syncPlotBoxData` method, suggesting a return to debugging or a rollback of the previous change.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM**: Introduction of a hardcoded contract number filter in `Contact.php` for `base_contracts`, indicating a switch to specific contract testing.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM**: Commenting out the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE in `Contact.php`, simplifying the tax calculation logic.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM**: Change in the source of `TAX_AMOUNT` within `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs in `Contact.php`, potentially fixing a data calculation error.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM**: Modification of the contract number filter (from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`) and introduction of `CAST(... AS INT)` in `Contact.php`, suggesting refinement of data types for SQL subqueries.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM**: Reinstatement of the original date range filter in `Contact.php`, moving away from the hardcoded contract number.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:32:48 PM**: Completion and expansion of the final `SELECT` statement and `LEFT JOIN` clauses in `Contact.php`, making the SQL query fully functional and combining all necessary data.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM**: Removal of the `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging statement in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, indicating an attempt to run the full sync process.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM**: Reintroduction of the `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging statement in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, suggesting further debugging or an issue that required revisiting data inspection.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent File Modification**: The `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` file is the most frequently modified, undergoing numerous iterative changes within a single day. This indicates active development and refinement of its core data retrieval logic, specifically the `getDataWithDateRange` SQL query.
*   **SQL Query Refinement**: The `getDataWithDateRange` method's embedded SQL query sees continuous adjustments:
    *   **Filtering**: Repeated toggling between a specific `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter and a date range filter (`LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME`). This suggests a development cycle involving testing with specific data and then reverting to the general date-range functionality.
    *   **CTE Management**: The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE is repeatedly commented out and its inclusion in `contract_tax_totals` also toggled, hinting at a feature under review, temporary disablement, or debugging a specific part of the tax calculation.
    *   **Data Type Casting**: Brief introduction and removal of `CAST(... AS INT)` for subquery results, indicating experimentation with or troubleshooting of data type compatibility in the SQL.
    *   **Column Sourcing**: Changes in which table's `TAX_AMOUNT` column is used for calculations in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs.
    *   **SQL Completeness**: The final entries for `Contact.php` show the completion of the long `SELECT` statement and the necessary joins, indicating the final assembly of the complex query.
*   **Debugging Practices**: The presence and subsequent removal (and re-addition) of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` highlights a common debugging pattern where developers inspect intermediate data structures before allowing the full process to run.
*   **Error Handling and Logging**: Both files show consistent use of `Log::error` for exception handling, ensuring issues are recorded. The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` also includes `Log::info` for tracking successful associations.
*   **HubSpot Integration**: The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` consistently manages HubSpot interactions for contacts, deals, and location associations, utilizing dedicated service classes (`HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`) and a mapper (`PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`). This indicates a focus on robust CRM integration.
*   **Batch Processing**: The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` processes data in batches (`primaryContactBatch`, `deceasedContactBatch`, `dealsBatch`), which is a common strategy for performance and efficiency when dealing with external APIs.

## 2:20:31 PM
The provided logs detail a series of changes across two PHP files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`. The changes are concentrated on a single day, 1/21/2026, and extend into 1/22/2026, indicating active development and debugging.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM (Initial State):** This file contains a Laravel Eloquent model named `Contact` for interacting with a Snowflake database table `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT`. It defines `fillable` attributes and Eloquent relationships. The core functionality is the `getDataWithDateRange` static method, which executes a complex SQL query to retrieve contract and contact data, including details about fees, taxes, contract writers, and item counts, filtered by a date range and optionally by contract status for production environments. This initial version includes a `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and references it in `contract_tax_totals`. The main `WHERE` clause in `base_contracts` filters by `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` in `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER` and `DIM_CONTACT` tables, respectively.
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 1:37:28 PM:** A significant change is introduced within the `getDataWithDateRange` method. The original date range filtering condition in the `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause (`(CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}' OR EXISTS (...))`) is commented out. In its place, a hardcoded filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` is added. This suggests a debugging or testing phase, focusing on a specific contract. The overall structure and other CTEs remain largely the same.
    *   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its corresponding join (`LEFT JOIN cancelled_contract_fee_tax ccft ON bc.CONTRACT_ID = ccft.CONTRACT_ID`) in `contract_tax_totals` are commented out. The `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` part is also commented out from the `total_tax` calculation. This indicates a temporary removal or deactivation of logic related to cancelled contract fees.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:** Small adjustments are made within the `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs. The `SUM` aggregate now references `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` instead of `f.TAX_AMOUNT` (for contract fees) and `df.TAX_AMOUNT` instead of `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` (for deed fees). Additionally, `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` is changed to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` (capital 'I').
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM:** The `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` in `contract_fee_tax` is corrected back to `f.TAX_AMOUNT`, and `df.TAX_AMOUNT` in `deed_fee_tax` is corrected back to `df.TAX_AMOUNT` (it was `cf.TAX_AMOUNT`). The `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` change remains.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:** Casting is introduced in the `WHERE` clauses for `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs. `cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` becomes `cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT))`. This suggests a type compatibility issue or explicit type conversion requirement in the database query.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM:** The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` in the `base_contracts` CTE is changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM:** The `CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` syntax is slightly malformed, missing parentheses around the subquery in `deed_fee_tax` and `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` (e.g., `WHERE df.CONTRACT_ID IN SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)`). This is likely a syntax error introduced during a rapid change.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM:** The `CAST` operations within the `WHERE IN` clauses for `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` are removed, reverting to `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)`. The missing parenthesis issue in `deed_fee_tax` is implicitly fixed by this revert.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM - 4:27:46 PM:** The reference `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` is re-introduced into the `contract_tax_totals` CTE, but then commented out again. This indicates indecision or testing related to the inclusion of cancelled contract fees in the total tax calculation. By the last change in this file, the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its related `LEFT JOIN` and `COALESCE` in `contract_tax_totals` remain commented out.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM - 4:32:48 PM:** The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter in `base_contracts` is fully commented out, and the original date range filter (`(CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}' OR EXISTS (...))`) is uncommented, restoring the intended date-based filtering. The structure of the `SELECT` statement joining various CTEs at the end also shows slight truncations/additions, specifically relating to `COALESCE(ic.mausoleum_owned, 0) AS Mausoleum_Owned,` and subsequent lines, indicating iterative development and possibly copy-paste issues with partially saved lines.
    *   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM - 11:25:33 AM (Final State):** The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE is completely removed (not just commented out), and its reference from `contract_tax_totals` is also removed, simplifying the tax calculation to only include `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax`. The final `SELECT` statement is fully present and correctly formatted.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** This file defines `PlotBoxHubSpotService` responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot. It handles primary contacts, deceased contacts, deals, and location associations. A `dd($dealsBatch)` (dump and die) statement is present immediately after populating the batch arrays, which would halt execution for debugging.
    *   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` statement is removed. This indicates the completion of a debugging step that required inspecting the `$dealsBatch` variable.
    *   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM - 11:25:42 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` statement is re-introduced and then removed again. This suggests a recurring need to debug the `$dealsBatch` or related data, possibly due to new data patterns or issues encountered during integration testing.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM:** Initial modification to `Contact.php` by commenting out date filters and adding a hardcoded contract number for testing.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** Commenting out the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` logic in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM - 4:26:47 PM:** A series of rapid, small adjustments, fixes, and re-introductions/removals of `CAST` and commented code within `Contact.php`, pointing to active debugging and iteration on the SQL query logic.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** Restoration of the original date range filter in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** Removal of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` (initial debugging complete).
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM:** Final cleanup in `Contact.php`, removing the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE entirely.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM - 11:25:42 AM:** Re-introduction and subsequent removal of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` (recurrent debugging).

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging via Commenting/Hardcoding:** Both files show a clear pattern of using comments and hardcoded values (like `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '...'` in `Contact.php` or `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`) to isolate and test specific parts of the code. This is a common debugging practice.
*   **Iterative SQL Query Refinement:** In `Contact.php`, there are many small, rapid changes to the SQL query logic, particularly concerning tax calculations (`cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE) and type casting (`CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID ... AS INT)`). This suggests a process of trial-and-error, likely in conjunction with testing against a database.
*   **Focus on Contract Data:** The core of the changes revolves around fetching and processing contract-related data, including contacts, fees, and items, from the `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` schema.
*   **HubSpot Integration:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService` consistently manages batches for primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals, indicating an ongoing process to synchronize this detailed contract information into a CRM system (HubSpot).
*   **Resilience and Logging:** The `processContacts` method in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` wraps critical operations (primary contacts, deceased contacts, deals, associations) in individual `try-catch` blocks, logging errors but attempting to continue processing other batches. This highlights a design goal for robust, fault-tolerant data synchronization.
*   **Temporary Debug Statements:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` statement in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` appearing and disappearing indicates temporary insertion for inspecting data flow.

## 4:20:29 PM
The provided log details changes across two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`** (Multiple changes between 1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM and 1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM):
    *   This file, a Laravel Eloquent model for `Contact` within the `PlotBox` namespace, primarily deals with fetching contact and contract data from a Snowflake warehouse.
    *   The `getDataWithDateRange` static method, which executes a complex SQL query, was the focus of almost all changes.
    *   **Initial State (1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM):** The `base_contracts` CTE (Common Table Expression) in the SQL query filtered contracts based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within a specified date range. A `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was included and its total was added to `contract_tax_totals`.
    *   **Testing/Debugging (1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM to 1/21/2026, 1:37:28 PM):** The `WHERE` clause in the `base_contracts` CTE was commented out and replaced with a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'`. This suggests local testing or debugging for a specific contract.
    *   **Further Refinement/Debugging (1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM to 1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM):** The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was entirely commented out, and consequently, the `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` part was also commented out from the `contract_tax_totals` CTE. Additionally, a minor correction was made in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, changing `f.TAX_AMOUNT` to `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` and `df.TAX_AMOUNT` respectively. The literal 'interest' was capitalized to 'Interest' in the `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` condition.
    *   **Syntax Changes (1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM to 1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM):** In the `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` (when it was present), `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` was changed to `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT))`. This attempted cast of the subquery result to `INT` was then partially reverted, specifically removing the outer `CAST(...)` but keeping the inner `SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts` directly in the `IN` clause.
    *   **Reversion/Finalization of Tax CTE (1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM to 1/21/2026, 4:32:48 PM):** The casting to `INT` was fully removed from the `IN` clauses for contract IDs. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was re-commented out, and the reference to `ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total` in `contract_tax_totals` was consistently commented out as well. The hardcoded contract number filter (`DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'`) in `base_contracts` was also commented out, restoring the original date range and `EXISTS` clause filtering.
    *   **Final Update (1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM):** The SQL query had the `LEFT JOIN item_counts ic` clause at the very end of the main `SELECT` statement fully visible, which was previously truncated in the logs. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its inclusion in `contract_tax_totals` remained fully removed (not just commented). This indicates a more permanent removal of this specific tax calculation. The hardcoded contract number filter in `base_contracts` was still commented out.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`** (Changes at 1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM and 1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM, 11:25:42 AM):
    *   This file is responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot.
    *   **Debugging Insertion (1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM):** A `dd($dealsBatch);` statement (Laravel's "dump and die" for debugging) was temporarily added immediately after populating the batch arrays within the `syncPlotBoxData` method. This paused execution to inspect the `dealsBatch` data.
    *   **Debugging Removal (1/22/26, 11:19:31 AM):** The `dd($dealsBatch);` line was removed, indicating the debugging step was complete and the code was returned to its operational state.
    *   **No functional change on 1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM**: The content is identical to the 11:19:31 AM entry, suggesting a save without code modification, or possibly an undo/redo that restored the previous version.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM:** Initial capture or base version of the `Contact.php` model with a comprehensive SQL query.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 1:37:28 PM:** Introduction of a hardcoded contract number filter in `Contact.php`, indicating focused debugging.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** Insertion of a `dd()` statement in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` to debug data mapping for HubSpot.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM - 4:16:07 PM:** Commenting out of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and minor corrections in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM - 4:23:56 PM:** Attempted and partially reverted `CAST` operations on subqueries in `Contact.php`, likely for type compatibility issues in the SQL.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM - 4:32:48 PM:** Removal of the hardcoded contract number and full restoration of date-range filtering in `Contact.php`, alongside the final decision to remove `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` from the `contract_tax_totals` calculation.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** Removal of the `dd()` statement in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, signaling an end to that debugging session.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM:** Final cleanup and re-formatting/completion of the SQL query in `Contact.php`, solidifying the changes made on the previous day.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus on `Contact.php` and its SQL query:** The overwhelming majority of changes revolve around the `getDataWithDateRange` method in `Contact.php`, specifically the embedded SQL query. This suggests ongoing development, optimization, or debugging of how contract and contact data is retrieved from the Snowflake database.
*   **SQL Query Refinements:**
    *   There's a recurring pattern of commenting/uncommenting the date range filter in favor of a hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` for testing, followed by reverting to the original date-based filter.
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was a specific area of modification, first included, then commented out, and finally effectively removed from the `contract_tax_totals` calculation in the latest versions.
    *   Small but important syntax adjustments in the SQL (`cf.TAX_AMOUNT` vs `f.TAX_AMOUNT`, `LOWER('interest')`, `CAST(... AS INT)`) indicate careful review and correction of the SQL logic.
*   **Debugging Workflow:** The sequence of adding a `dd()` statement (dump and die) in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` and then removing it, combined with the temporary hardcoding and commenting of SQL filters in `Contact.php`, demonstrates a typical iterative debugging process.
*   **Data Integration (`PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`):** This service consistently handles the synchronization of data to HubSpot, involving mapping contacts and deals, searching for existing records, creating/updating them, and managing associations. The changes here are minimal, indicating that the core logic was stable but required debugging for the data input.
*   **Consistency in Model Structure:** The basic structure of the `Contact` model (table, primary key, fillable fields, and relationships) remains constant throughout the logs, indicating that the core entity definition is stable.
