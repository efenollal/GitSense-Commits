# Activity Summary for 1/26/2026

## 12:24:06 AM
The logs show continuous development and debugging activity primarily focused on two PHP files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`. The timestamp range for these changes is from 1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM to 1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM.

### File-Specific Updates:

**1. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
This file, representing an Eloquent Model for `Contact` in a `PlotBox` namespace, undergoes numerous modifications across multiple timestamps on both 1/21/2026 and 1/22/2026. The core of the changes is within the `getDataWithDateRange` static method, which executes a complex SQL query to retrieve contract and contact data from a Snowflake warehouse.

*   **Initial State (1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM):** The query uses a `WHERE` clause to filter `DIM_CONTRACT` records by `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or by the `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` of associated `DIM_CONTACT` records, both within a specified `fromDate` and `toDate` range. It also includes a `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` Common Table Expression (CTE) and references it in `contract_tax_totals`.
*   **Introduced Debugging/Testing (1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM):** A significant pattern emerges where the original date range filtering in the `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause is commented out. In its place, a specific `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` filter is added, suggesting a shift to target specific contract data for testing or debugging.
    *   Around 1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM, the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE is commented out entirely, and its reference in `contract_tax_totals` is also commented out. This change persists in subsequent versions, implying it was intentionally removed or temporarily disabled.
    *   At 1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM, a subtle change occurs in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs: `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` is changed to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` and `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` to `SUM(df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)`. This is a bug fix, correcting the tax amount aggregation by referencing `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` and `df.TAX_AMOUNT` (which are non-existent or incorrect aliases) instead of `f.TAX_AMOUNT`. This is likely an error introduced and corrected in a short span.
*   **Further Refinements (1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM - 1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM):** The `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` condition is updated to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` in the `contract_fee_tax` CTE, indicating a case-sensitivity correction.
    *   At 1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM, an attempt is made to cast `SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts` to an integer `(CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT))` within the `WHERE` clauses of `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE. This syntax is incorrect for subqueries in `IN` clauses.
*   **Correction and Reversion (1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM - 1/21/2026, 4:29:42 PM):** The specific `CONTRACT_NUMBER` used in the `base_contracts` CTE is changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`. The incorrect `CAST(SELECT ... AS INT)` syntax is removed from the `WHERE` clauses of the tax-related CTEs (seen around 1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM), reverting to `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)`.
    *   The commented out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its reference in `contract_tax_totals` remain consistent.
*   **Final State (1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM - 1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM):** The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter `'110814'` is commented out in `base_contracts`, re-enabling the original date range filtering `(CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}' OR EXISTS (...))`. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remains commented out throughout, and its reference is also consistently commented out in `contract_tax_totals`. The SQL joins in the final `SELECT` statement are expanded to include `item_counts` and other CTEs.

**2. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
This file handles the synchronization of PlotBox data to HubSpot.

*   **Snapshot 1 (1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM):** This version includes a `dd($dealsBatch)` statement (a `die()` and `var_dump()` equivalent in Laravel), indicating that the code execution was halted here for inspection during development or debugging.
*   **Snapshot 2 (1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM):** The `dd($dealsBatch)` statement is removed. This suggests the debugging related to `dealsBatch` was completed, and the sync process was allowed to continue past that point.
*   **Snapshot 3 (1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM):** The `dd($dealsBatch)` statement is re-introduced, indicating a return to debugging at the same point, likely to re-verify the `dealsBatch` data or investigate a subsequent issue.
*   **Final State (1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM):** The `dd($dealsBatch)` statement is removed again, allowing the script to proceed.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM:** Introduction of hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter and commenting out date range in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** Addition of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` to pause execution for debugging.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** Commenting out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:** Bug fix attempt in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs (incorrect `cf.TAX_AMOUNT`/`df.TAX_AMOUNT` reference) in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:** Introduction of incorrect `CAST(... AS INT)` syntax in `WHERE` clauses in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM:** Removal of incorrect `CAST(... AS INT)` syntax in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** Re-enabling of date range filter and commenting out hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** Removal of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM:** Re-introduction of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM:** Final removal of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM:** The `Contact.php` file reaches a state similar to its initial version regarding the main `WHERE` clause, but the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remains commented out.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Consistent File Modification:** Almost all changes revolve around the `Contact.php` model, specifically the large SQL query within the `getDataWithDateRange` method. This indicates active development or debugging of data retrieval logic.
*   **SQL Query Iteration:** The SQL query is repeatedly modified, often with minor adjustments, commenting/uncommenting sections, and introducing/correcting syntax, suggesting a process of trial and error or fine-tuning the data extraction.
*   **Debugging Markers:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` function is used multiple times in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` as a temporary debug step to inspect data at a particular point in the execution flow.
*   **Commented-Out Code:** Both files show patterns of commenting out sections of code for temporary disabling or testing, most notably the date range filter in `Contact.php` (replaced by a hardcoded contract number) and the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE.
*   **Focus on Contract Data:** The changes in `Contact.php` consistently aim to refine how contract, contact, fee, and item count data are aggregated and joined, primarily from `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` tables.
*   **Minor Syntax Fixes:** The `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` capitalization and the `CAST(... AS INT)` subquery error indicate attempts to correct SQL syntax or logic.

## 1:24:23 AM
The provided log details changes across two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

### File-Specific Updates:

#### `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`

This file, a Laravel Eloquent model for `Contact` within the `PlotBox` namespace, primarily deals with fetching contract and contact data from a Snowflake data warehouse. The changes observed are consistently focused on the `getDataWithDateRange` static method, which executes a complex SQL query.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM (Initial State):** The query filters `DIM_CONTRACT` based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within a `{$fromDate}` and `{$toDate}` range. It includes `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` in the `contract_tax_totals` CTE.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** A notable and recurring pattern begins. The date range filter in the `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause is commented out. In its place, a hardcoded filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` is introduced. This suggests a debugging or specific data testing phase. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its inclusion in `contract_tax_totals` are also consistently commented out during this period, indicating that tax calculation for cancelled contracts was temporarily removed or disabled.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:** Small changes appear in the `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs. The `SUM` aggregations change from `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` for `contract_fee_tax` and `SUM(df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` for `deed_fee_tax`. It seems there was a typo where `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` was used instead of `f.TAX_AMOUNT` in `contract_fee_tax` and `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` instead of `df.TAX_AMOUNT` in `deed_fee_tax`. The `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` filter in `contract_fee_tax` also changes to `'Interest'` (capital 'I'). The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remains commented out.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM:** Corrects the tax amount in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` from `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` / `df.TAX_AMOUNT` to `f.TAX_AMOUNT` and `f.TAX_AMOUNT` respectively. The `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` casing remains. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its reference are still commented out.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM - 1/21/2026, 4:20:28 PM:** Further adjustments are made within the SQL query, specifically adding `CAST(... AS INT)` around `SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts` in the `WHERE` clauses of `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE. This indicates a type casting issue or a move to enforce integer types for contract IDs in subqueries. The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` changes from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM - 1/21/2026, 4:29:42 PM:** The `CAST(... AS INT)` is removed again in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` subqueries. There are several minor changes in commenting/uncommenting the `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` line in `contract_tax_totals`, suggesting back-and-forth testing or decision-making regarding cancelled contract fees.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM - 1/22/2026, 11:25:33 AM:** The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter is removed, and the original date range filtering logic based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` and `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` is restored. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remains commented out. The `contract_tax_totals` CTE also definitively removes its reference to `ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total`. In the final state (1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM onwards), the `FROM` clause of the main `SELECT` statement is fully defined, joining `primary_contacts`, `deceased_contacts`, `contract_writers`, `contract_net_prices`, `item_counts`, and `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_FACILITY` tables.

#### `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`

This file is responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot CRM.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** A `dd($dealsBatch);` (dump and die) statement is added after populating the batch arrays (`primaryContactBatch`, `deceasedContactBatch`, `dealsBatch`, `locationAssociations`) in the `syncPlotBoxData` method. This line would halt execution to inspect the contents of `$dealsBatch`.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement is removed. This indicates that the debugging step for `$dealsBatch` was completed.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement is reintroduced in the `syncPlotBoxData` method, suggesting a re-initiation of debugging for the `dealsBatch` or related data mapping.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement is removed again, completing the second debugging session.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** Initial debugging phase in `Contact.php` using a hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter and commenting out date range and cancelled fee tax.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:** Correction of tax amount source (`f.TAX_AMOUNT` vs `cf.TAX_AMOUNT`/`df.TAX_AMOUNT`) and casing of 'Interest' fee type in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:** Introduction of `CAST(... AS INT)` for subqueries and a change in the hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` to `'110814'` in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** Reversion of `Contact.php`'s `getDataWithDateRange` method to use the original date range filtering and permanent removal of cancelled fee tax calculation.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM, 1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM:** `dd($dealsBatch);` is added to `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, indicating debugging.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM, 1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM:** `dd($dealsBatch);` is removed from `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, indicating completion of debugging.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM:** The SQL query's final `FROM` clause in `Contact.php` is fully formed with all necessary `LEFT JOIN` statements.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Debugging Cycle:** The `Contact.php` file shows a clear pattern of introducing a hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter and commenting out date range logic for focused testing/debugging, followed by reverting these changes. Similarly, `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` exhibits a pattern of adding and removing `dd($dealsBatch);` for inspection.
*   **SQL Query Refinement:** The `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query is constantly being modified, primarily in its `WHERE` clause conditions (date range vs. specific contract number) and calculations for `contract_tax_totals`, specifically the inclusion/exclusion of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`. There were also adjustments related to correct tax column referencing and explicit type casting.
*   **Incremental Development:** Changes are mostly small and iterative, suggesting continuous development, testing, and refinement of the data retrieval and synchronization logic.
*   **Focus on PlotBox Integration:** Both files are related to the "PlotBox" system, implying ongoing work on data integration or synchronization processes.
*   **Database Interaction:** Both files heavily interact with a database, specified as `snowflake`, and reference various `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_` tables (e.g., `DIM_CONTRACT`, `DIM_CONTACT`, `DIM_PAYMENT_SCHEDULE`, `DIM_CONTRACT_FEE`, `DIM_DEED_FEE`, `DIM_CANCELLED_CONTRACT_FEE`, `DIM_CONTRACT_WRITER`, `DIM_SYSTEM_USER`, `DIM_CONTRACT_ITEM`, `DIM_FEE`, `DIM_FEE_CATEGORY`, `DIM_FACILITY`).
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` consistently includes `try-catch` blocks with `Log::error` calls, highlighting a focus on robust error handling during the HubSpot synchronization process.

## 10:37:40 AM
The changes primarily involve two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`. The bulk of the modifications occurred on January 21, 2026, and January 22, 2026.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **Timestamps:** This file was modified repeatedly on January 21, 2026, between 12:51 PM and 4:32 PM, and then again on January 22, 2026, at 11:24 AM and 11:25 AM, and a final time at 2:29 PM.
    *   **Content Changes:**
        *   **SQL Query in `getDataWithDateRange` method:** The most consistent changes were to the large SQL query within the `getDataWithDateRange` static method.
        *   **Contract Number Filtering:** The `WHERE` clause in the `base_contracts` CTE (Common Table Expression) was frequently toggled between a specific `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter (e.g., `'645-110814'`, then `'110814'`) and a commented-out date range filter.
            *   Initially (1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM), the date range filter was active.
            *   From 1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM, a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` filter was introduced, and the date range filter was commented out. This specific contract number changed to `'110814'` at 1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM.
            *   At 1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM, and consistently thereafter until 1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM, the hardcoded contract number filter was commented out, and the original date range filter was reactivated.
        *   **`cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE:** This CTE was consistently commented out and then re-commented out in multiple commits (e.g., 1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM, 4:05:53 PM, 4:16:07 PM, 4:20:08 PM, 4:20:13 PM, 4:20:28 PM, 4:23:56 PM, 4:26:14 PM, 4:26:47 PM, 4:27:14 PM, 4:29:42 PM, 4:31:12 PM, 4:32:48 PM). The commenting out of `ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total` from the `contract_tax_totals` CTE, which was dependent on this, also occurred in conjunction.
        *   **Type Casting in `WHERE` Clauses:** On 1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM, and subsequent commits until 1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM, there were attempts to cast the subquery `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` to `INT` within the `WHERE` clauses of `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs. These `CAST` operations were removed at 1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM.
        *   **Column Aliases in `SELECT` Statement:** The final `SELECT` statement had its ending truncated in several logs (e.g., 1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM, 12:52:00 PM, 12:54:01 PM), indicating a copy-paste error in the logging, but the actual code shows that the `COALESCE(ic.other_services_owned, 0)` was sometimes truncated as well, and was fully restored at 1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM. The final join `LEFT JOIN item_counts ic` also appears truncated in many logs.
*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **Timestamps:** This file was modified on January 21, 2026, at 12:54:56 PM, and again on January 22, 2026, at 11:19:31 AM and 11:25:42 AM.
    *   **Content Changes:**
        *   **`dd($dealsBatch)` call:** A `dd($dealsBatch)` (dump and die) statement was present immediately after populating the batch arrays within the `syncPlotBoxData` method at 1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM and 1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM. This `dd()` call was removed in the commit at 1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM, indicating debugging activity, and then re-introduced later at 1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM.
        *   The rest of the `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` code remained largely consistent throughout the logged changes, focusing on synchronizing PlotBox data to HubSpot, handling contacts, deals, and location associations with error logging and retry mechanisms (sleeps).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging Focus:** The most prominent pattern is the repeated toggling of a specific `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter and the commenting out/in of the date range filter in `Contact.php`, along with the presence and removal of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`. This strongly suggests active debugging and testing of the SQL query and data processing logic.
*   **Consistent Structure:** Despite the debugging changes, the overall structure of the `Contact.php` model, including its Eloquent relationships, fillable properties, and the multi-CTE SQL query, remained stable.
*   **Snowflake Connection:** The `const CONNECTION = 'snowflake';` in the `Contact` model indicates a consistent use of Snowflake as the database.
*   **PlotBox Integration:** Both files are heavily involved in the "PlotBox" domain, with `Contact.php` fetching data from `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE` tables and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` handling synchronization of this data to HubSpot.
*   **Error Handling:** Both files include `try-catch` blocks and `Log::error` calls, indicating robust error handling in the data fetching and synchronization processes.
