# Activity Summary for 1/21/2026

## 1:22:56 PM
The log entries detail changes across two PHP files within a Datalink application, specifically related to data extraction from a Snowflake database and subsequent synchronization with HubSpot.

### File-Specific Updates:

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
This file defines an Eloquent model for `Contact` within the `PlotBox` namespace, interacting with a Snowflake database (`PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT`). It includes relationships and a static method `getDataWithDateRange` to fetch comprehensive contact and contract information.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM (Initial State):** The `getDataWithDateRange` method executed a complex SQL query with multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs). This query was designed to retrieve various details including contract IDs, purchase dates, last updated dates, contract owners, total cash price, facility information, and detailed item counts (e.g., caskets, cremation products, ground, markers, mausoleum, niche, urns, vaults). It also identified primary and deceased contacts associated with contracts. The data filtering was based on a date range provided to the method (`$fromDate`, `$toDate`) for `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` and `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME`, with an additional production-only filter for `DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS = 'Approved'`.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM (Debugging/Testing):** The core filtering logic within the `base_contracts` CTE in `getDataWithDateRange` was modified. The dynamic date range filtering based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` was commented out and replaced with a hardcoded `WHERE DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'`. This indicates a temporary change, likely for debugging or testing a specific contract's data. The log entry also shows truncation in the final `SELECT` clause of the SQL query.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM (Minor Refinement during Debugging):** The hardcoded contract number filter and commented-out date range filtering persisted from the previous change. A minor adjustment was made in the final `SELECT` statement's `Purchase_Price` calculation, changing `COALESCE(cnp.net_price, pc.TOTAL_CASH_PRICE, 0)` to `COALESCE(cnp.net_price, 0)`. This removed `pc.TOTAL_CASH_PRICE` as a fallback, making `net_price` the sole source for `Purchase_Price` or defaulting to 0. The truncation in the final `SELECT` clause was also present in this log entry.

**`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
This file defines a service responsible for orchestrating the synchronization of PlotBox data (presumably extracted via models like `Contact.php`) into HubSpot CRM.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM (Initial/Major Update):** This entry introduces or heavily modifies the `PlotBoxHubSpotService`. It integrates `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`, and a `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`. The `syncPlotBoxData` method is the central point, designed to:
    *   Fetch PlotBox data using `getDataForCrmSync`.
    *   Map the fetched data into HubSpot-compatible structures for primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals.
    *   It contains a `dd($dealsBatch);` statement, indicating that the code was in a debugging state, stopping execution before the actual HubSpot API calls were made to process contacts, deals, and associations.
    *   The `processContacts` method is outlined with extensive logic for searching, creating, and updating contacts and deals, including contact-deal, contact-location, and deal-location associations. Each major operation is wrapped in individual `try-catch` blocks for resilience, logging errors without stopping the entire sync. `sleep` calls (10 seconds, 5 seconds) are strategically placed, likely to manage HubSpot API rate limits or allow for processing time.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM:** Initial implementation of the `getDataWithDateRange` method in `Contact.php` with dynamic date filtering.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM:** Key change in `Contact.php` to hardcode the contract number filter, effectively disabling the date range functionality for debugging.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM:** Minor refinement in `Contact.php` regarding `Purchase_Price` calculation, maintaining the debugging state.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** Introduction or significant update of `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, outlining the HubSpot synchronization logic, but paused in a debugging state (`dd($dealsBatch);`).

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Snowflake Database Usage:** Both files, directly or indirectly, interact with data sourced from a Snowflake warehouse (`PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS`), indicating a central data repository for PlotBox information.
*   **Complex Data Aggregation:** The `Contact.php` model uses highly complex SQL queries with numerous CTEs to prepare and aggregate detailed contract and contact data, suggesting a need for rich, pre-processed datasets.
*   **HubSpot Integration Focus:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` is entirely dedicated to synchronizing this detailed PlotBox data to HubSpot, implying that HubSpot serves as the CRM for these business operations.
*   **Robustness and Error Handling:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService` demonstrates a strong pattern of wrapping individual processing steps (creating contacts, updating deals, associating entities) in `try-catch` blocks. This ensures that failures in one part of the synchronization do not completely halt the entire process, allowing for partial success and comprehensive error logging.
*   **Debugging Mode:** The presence of commented-out code, hardcoded filter values (in `Contact.php`), and explicit `dd()` statements (in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`) across recent timestamps strongly indicates that the codebase was under active development and debugging.
*   **API Interaction Management:** The inclusion of `sleep` calls in `PlotBoxHubSpotService` points to strategies for managing external API rate limits or allowing sufficient time for external systems (HubSpot) to process requests.
*   **Layered Architecture:** The separation of concerns is evident with distinct models for data access (`Contact.php`), services for business logic (`PlotBoxHubSpotService`), mappers for data transformation (`PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`), and dedicated HubSpot service classes (`HubSpotContactService`, etc.).

## 2:22:40 PM
The provided log details changes across two PHP files within a Laravel application focused on integrating "PlotBox" data with HubSpot and querying a Snowflake data warehouse.

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**

*   **Initial State (1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM):** This file defines an Eloquent model for `Contact` connected to a Snowflake `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE`. It includes relationships and a `getDataWithDateRange` static method. This method executes a large, complex SQL query with multiple Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to retrieve comprehensive contract and contact data, including details on associated fees, taxes, writers, and item counts, filtered by a date range and an optional production-specific contract status. The final `SELECT` statement constructs a detailed output with aliased columns like `Primary_First_Name`, `Deceased_Last_Name`, `Purchase_Price`, and various `_Owned` item counts.
*   **First Update (1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM):** A significant change was made within the `getDataWithDateRange` method. The original date range filtering logic in the `base_contracts` CTE, which checked `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` for contracts and `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` for contacts, was commented out. It was replaced with a hardcoded `WHERE DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'`, indicating a focused test or debugging effort for a specific contract.
*   **Second Update (1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM):** A minor adjustment occurred in the final `SELECT` statement within `getDataWithDateRange`. The `Purchase_Price` calculation, originally `COALESCE(cnp.net_price, pc.TOTAL_CASH_PRICE, 0)`, was modified to `COALESCE(cnp.net_price, 0)`. This change removes `pc.TOTAL_CASH_PRICE` as a fallback for the purchase price, implying a more direct reliance on `net_price` or a different default handling.

**File: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**

*   **Update (1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM):** This file, `PlotBoxHubSpotService`, is dedicated to synchronizing PlotBox data (retrieved from a repository) into HubSpot. It leverages `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, and `HubSpotLocationService` for managing CRM entities. The `syncPlotBoxData` method processes batches of primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals. A `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging statement was introduced directly after the data mapping, suggesting an active debugging phase to inspect the mapped deal data before further processing. The service includes a robust `processContacts` method which handles:
    *   Searching, creating, and updating primary and deceased contacts in HubSpot, with individual `try-catch` blocks and `Log::error` for resilience.
    *   Introducing `sleep(10)` and `sleep(5)` calls, likely to mitigate HubSpot API rate limits or ensure previous operations complete before dependent ones.
    *   Merging contacts by account and associating primary/deceased contacts.
    *   Searching, creating, and updating deals.
    *   Associating contacts and deals with specific locations, with detailed logging and error handling for each association type.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging and Testing:** A clear pattern of debugging or testing activity is evident. In `Contact.php`, the date range filter was replaced with a hardcoded contract number for targeted data retrieval. In `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, the `dd($dealsBatch)` function halted execution for inspecting data, and `sleep()` calls were added, common in API integration testing.
*   **HubSpot Integration:** Both files are part of a larger system integrating data from "PlotBox" (likely a source system) into HubSpot, focusing on contacts, contracts (deals), and locations.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService` demonstrates a commitment to fault tolerance with extensive `try-catch` blocks and `Log::error` statements to manage potential failures during HubSpot API interactions.
*   **Complex Data Transformation:** The `Contact.php` model's `getDataWithDateRange` method involves an elaborate SQL query to aggregate disparate data points into a cohesive structure, highlighting the complexity of the data being processed.
*   **Truncated Log Entries:** All log entries for both files appear to be truncated at the end of the code snippet, making it difficult to assess the full extent of the changes or the complete state of the files.

## 3:22:43 PM
The log details development activities primarily focused on data synchronization from a PlotBox source to HubSpot CRM.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **Initial state (1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM):** The `getDataWithDateRange` method contained a complex SQL query designed to fetch contract and contact data based on a date range, including a filter for `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` on both contracts and contract owners.
    *   **Significant Change (1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM):** The date range filtering condition within the `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query was commented out. It was replaced with a hardcoded `WHERE DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'`. This indicates a temporary modification, likely for debugging or testing a specific contract, bypassing the dynamic date filter.
    *   **Subsequent Saves (1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM and 1/21/2026, 1:37:28 PM):** No further functional code changes were observed in this file. These entries represent saves of the same state with the hardcoded contract number filter in place, reinforcing the likelihood of ongoing testing or debugging.
    *   The file consistently defines an Eloquent model for `Contact`, uses a 'snowflake' connection, and handles relationships with `ContractOwner` and `Contract` models. The SQL query structure (using multiple Common Table Expressions for `base_contracts`, `payment_schedule_totals`, `contract_fee_tax`, etc.) remained consistent across changes, focusing on aggregating various contract and fee details.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **Timestamp (1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM):** This file was updated concurrently with the `Contact.php` changes, suggesting related development work.
    *   The `PlotBoxHubSpotService` is responsible for orchestrating the synchronization of PlotBox data (mapped from data structures potentially generated by the `Contact` model's query) to HubSpot.
    *   It initializes various HubSpot services (`HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`) and a `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`.
    *   The `syncPlotBoxData` method includes logic to fetch data, map it into batches for primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals, and then process these batches.
    *   A `dd($dealsBatch);` statement is present, which is a debugging function in Laravel, indicating active development or testing of the data mapping and preparation steps.
    *   The `processContacts` method extensively handles the creation, updating, and association of contacts, deals, and locations in HubSpot. It employs individual `try-catch` blocks for resilience and includes `sleep` calls (e.g., `sleep(10)`, `sleep(5)`) between operations, likely to manage HubSpot API rate limits or allow for asynchronous processing.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging/Testing Focus:** Both files show strong indications of active debugging or testing. `Contact.php` has a commented-out date filter replaced by a hardcoded value, and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` contains a `dd()` statement and `echo` calls for progress updates.
*   **Data Synchronization:** A clear overarching pattern is the effort to synchronize detailed contract and contact information from a "PlotBox" data warehouse to HubSpot CRM, involving complex data extraction (SQL) and multi-step CRM operations.
*   **Resilience in CRM Integration:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService` demonstrates a pattern of handling potential failures in CRM interactions through granular `try-catch` blocks and introducing delays, indicating an awareness of external API reliability and rate limits.
*   **Detailed Logging:** `Log::error` and `Log::info` statements are consistently used throughout the `PlotBoxHubSpotService` for tracking the synchronization process and diagnosing issues.

## 4:22:50 PM
The changes log primarily details modifications within two PHP files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

### File-Specific Updates:

**1. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
This file, representing an Eloquent model for contacts, undergoes a series of iterative changes focused on its `getDataWithDateRange` static method, which executes a complex Snowflake SQL query.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM (Base):** The initial state of the SQL query includes date range filtering for contracts and contract owners, and calculates various tax totals (`contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`) and item counts.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM:** The original date range filter in the `base_contracts` CTE is commented out and replaced with a hardcoded filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'`. This suggests specific contract debugging. The log entry appears to be cut off prematurely.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM:** The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter remains. The `COALESCE` logic for `Purchase_Price` in the final `SELECT` statement is simplified, removing `pc.TOTAL_CASH_PRICE` as a fallback. The log entry is again prematurely truncated.
*   **1/21/2026, 1:37:28 PM:** No functional changes are observed from the previous state; the hardcoded filter and truncated code persist.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its corresponding `LEFT JOIN` and `COALESCE` in the `contract_tax_totals` CTE are entirely commented out.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:** A potential bug fix or refactor occurs in the `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs. The tax amount calculation changes from `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * ...)` to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * ...)` for `contract_fee_tax` and `SUM(df.TAX_AMOUNT * ...)` for `deed_fee_tax`. The commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` also reflects this pattern `SUM(ccf.TAX_AMOUNT * ...)`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM:** The tax calculation in `contract_fee_tax` is corrected back to `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)`. The tax calculation in `deed_fee_tax` is changed to `SUM(df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)`. The `FEE_TYPE` comparison string 'interest' is capitalized to 'Interest'.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:** `CAST(... AS INT)` is added around subqueries `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` in the `WHERE` clauses of `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs to ensure integer casting.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM:** The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter is updated from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:28 PM:** No functional changes are observed from the previous state.

**2. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
This file defines a service for synchronizing PlotBox data to HubSpot.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** This log entry shows a complete service implementation. It initializes HubSpot services for contacts, deals, and locations, along with a PlotBox data mapper. The `syncPlotBoxData` method is designed to fetch PlotBox data (optionally by date filter), map it to HubSpot entities, and then process batches of primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals. A `dd($dealsBatch);` statement is present, which indicates a breakpoint or incomplete development/testing cycle, as it would halt execution before any HubSpot API calls are made. The `processContacts` method includes robust error handling with individual `try-catch` blocks and `sleep()` calls, suggesting consideration for API rate limits and resilience.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM:** Introduction of a hardcoded contract number filter for debugging in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** Full snapshot of `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` including mapping, batch processing, and a `dd()` statement, indicating active development.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** Removal (commenting out) of the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` calculation in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:** Initial significant modification to tax amount calculations in `Contact.php` (potentially introducing a bug by changing `f.TAX_AMOUNT` to `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` or `df.TAX_AMOUNT` incorrectly).
*   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM:** Correction of the tax amount calculation in `Contact.php` and an update to the `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE)` comparison string.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:** Introduction of `CAST(... AS INT)` for subqueries in `Contact.php` to ensure type consistency.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM:** Refinement of the hardcoded contract number in `Contact.php` (removal of `645-` prefix).

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Debugging/Testing:** The repeated commenting out of the date filter and the introduction of a hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter in `Contact.php` (`'645-110814'`, then `'110814'`) clearly indicate an active debugging or testing phase, focusing on a specific contract. The `dd($dealsBatch);` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` further supports this.
*   **SQL Query Refinement:** There's an iterative process of refining the complex SQL query in `Contact.php`, particularly concerning tax calculations and type casting for subqueries.
*   **Incomplete Log Entries:** Multiple entries for `Contact.php` consistently appear truncated at the end of the file content, suggesting an issue with the logging mechanism or how the content was captured.
*   **Modular HubSpot Integration:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` demonstrates a structured approach to CRM integration, separating concerns into contact, deal, and location services, and using a mapper for data transformation.
*   **Resilience and Rate Limiting:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` includes measures for fault tolerance (individual `try-catch` blocks) and API management (`sleep()` calls) for interactions with HubSpot.

## 6:22:57 PM
The changes log details modifications across two primary files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, all occurring on January 21, 2026.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`** (multiple updates between 12:51:05 PM and 4:32:48 PM):
    *   **Initial State (1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM):** The `getDataWithDateRange` method contains a comprehensive SQL query to pull contract and contact data from a Snowflake warehouse, including various subqueries for payment schedules, fees, tax calculations, contract writers, and item counts, filtered by a provided date range.
    *   **Debugging Phase (1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 4:29:42 PM):**
        *   The original date range filter in the `base_contracts` Common Table Expression (CTE) was commented out.
        *   A hardcoded filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` was introduced, later changed to `'110814'`, indicating targeted testing or debugging for a specific contract.
        *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was entirely commented out (1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM). Consequently, its contribution to the `total_tax` in the `contract_tax_totals` CTE was also commented out, then temporarily included with a potentially incorrect alias, and finally entirely removed from the summation (1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM).
        *   Minor adjustments were made to the `SUM` calculations in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, involving which `TAX_AMOUNT` column was referenced (e.g., changing from `f.TAX_AMOUNT` to `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` or `df.TAX_AMOUNT`). A case change from `'interest'` to `'Interest'` also occurred.
        *   Attempts were made to `CAST` the subquery results for `CONTRACT_ID` to `INT` within the `IN` clauses of several CTEs, but these changes were quickly reverted in subsequent commits (1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM - 4:26:14 PM), suggesting the casting was either problematic or unnecessary.
    *   **Reversion Phase (1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM - 4:32:48 PM):** The hardcoded contract number filter was commented out, and the original date range filter was uncommented and restored, indicating a return to the intended production logic.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`** (1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM):
    *   This log shows a service responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot, handling contacts, deals, and location associations.
    *   A critical change is the introduction of a `dd($dealsBatch);` statement within the `syncPlotBoxData` method. This Laravel "dump and die" helper would halt the script execution at that point, preventing any subsequent processing of contacts, deals, or associations. This strongly indicates active debugging was underway.
    *   The service is designed to fetch data, map it to HubSpot-compatible formats, and then perform search, create, update, and association operations for primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals, including associating them with locations. Sleep calls (`sleep(10)`, `sleep(5)`) are used between processing steps, likely to mitigate API rate limits. Error logging is also implemented.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM:** Start of `Contact.php` SQL query modification with commenting out of date filter and introduction of hardcoded contract number.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** Introduction of `dd($dealsBatch);` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, indicating active debugging halting the sync process.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** Commenting out of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM & 4:16:07 PM:** Refinement of tax amount summation logic in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM & 4:26:14 PM:** Introduction and subsequent reversion of `CAST` operations in subqueries within `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** Restoration of the original date range filtering in `Contact.php`, marking an end to the hardcoded contract number filtering.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging Focus:** A clear pattern of debugging is evident, with temporary hardcoded values and a `dd()` statement introduced to isolate and test specific parts of the data retrieval and synchronization process.
*   **SQL Query Iteration:** The `Contact.php` file shows multiple, rapid iterations of changes to a complex SQL query, suggesting active development, testing, and fine-tuning of the data extraction logic. These changes involve commenting out sections, adjusting calculations, attempting type casting, and then reverting some of these temporary modifications.
*   **Content Truncation:** All log entries for `Contact.php` are truncated at the end of the `SELECT` statement in the SQL query, specifically within the list of `item_counts` columns.

## 8:23:02 PM
The changes primarily focus on refining data retrieval logic within the `Contact` model and introducing a debugging halt in a HubSpot integration service.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**: This file, defining an Eloquent model for Snowflake contact data, underwent numerous modifications within its `getDataWithDateRange` SQL query.
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM:** The original dynamic date range filter in the `base_contracts` Common Table Expression (CTE) was commented out, and a specific contract number `'645-110814'` was hardcoded for filtering, likely for testing purposes.
    *   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its corresponding entry in the `contract_tax_totals` calculation were commented out, effectively removing cancelled fee taxes from the total tax calculation.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM & 4:16:07 PM:** The logic for summing tax amounts in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs was adjusted, correcting column references for `TAX_AMOUNT` (from `f.TAX_AMOUNT` to `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` or `df.TAX_AMOUNT`) and fixing a potential case sensitivity issue in a `FEE_TYPE` comparison (`'interest'` to `'Interest'`).
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:** Explicit `CAST(... AS INT)` statements were added around subqueries fetching `CONTRACT_ID` within `WHERE ... IN` clauses in the fee tax CTEs, presumably to resolve data type compatibility issues.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM:** The hardcoded contract number filter was changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM - 4:27:46 PM:** The `CAST(... AS INT)` changes introduced earlier were reverted, removing the explicit integer casting from the `WHERE IN` clauses of the fee tax CTEs. There was also a temporary erroneous reference to `cancelled_fee_tax_total` that was quickly commented out to align with the disabled `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE.
    *   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** The hardcoded contract number filter was removed, and the original dynamic date range filtering logic in `base_contracts` was reactivated, restoring the method's intended behavior.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**:
    *   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** A `dd($dealsBatch);` (dump and die) statement was inserted within the `syncPlotBoxData` method. This change effectively halts the execution of the data synchronization process at an early stage, indicating a debugging step to inspect the prepared deal data before further processing or API calls to HubSpot.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM:** Initial implementation of hardcoded contract number filter in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** Introduction of a critical debugging `dd()` statement in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` that stops data synchronization.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** Temporary modification of tax calculation logic by commenting out cancelled fees in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM - 4:16:07 PM:** Multiple iterative adjustments to tax amount column references in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** Reversion of `Contact.php` to dynamic date-range filtering, indicating the completion or conclusion of a testing phase for the hardcoded filter.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**

*   **Debugging Cycle:** A prominent pattern is the repeated toggling between dynamic and hardcoded query filters in `Contact.php`, along with direct debugging (`dd()`) in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, strongly suggesting an active testing and debugging phase of the data synchronization pipeline.
*   **SQL Query Fine-tuning:** Extensive modifications to the complex SQL query in `Contact.php` indicate an ongoing effort to refine data aggregation, particularly concerning tax calculations and data type handling.
*   **Commenting for Temporary Exclusion:** The frequent commenting and uncommenting of specific SQL clauses or CTEs (like `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` and date filters) is a recurring technique for isolating parts of the query during development.
