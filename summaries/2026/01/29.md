# Activity Summary for 1/29/2026

## 8:58:58 AM
The changes primarily focus on two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` (multiple timestamps between 1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM and 1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM):**
    *   This file, a Laravel Eloquent model named `Contact` for the `PlotBox` namespace, is responsible for retrieving contact and contract data from a Snowflake warehouse (`PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT`).
    *   The core changes revolve around the `getDataWithDateRange` static method, which executes a complex SQL query.
    *   **Initial Change (1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM):** A significant modification was made to the `WHERE` clause of the `base_contracts` CTE (Common Table Expression). The original date range filtering `(CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}' OR EXISTS (...))` was commented out and replaced with a hardcoded filter `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'`. This suggests a debugging or specific contract testing scenario.
    *   **Subsequent Changes (1/21/2026, 12:54:01 PM to 1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM):** The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter in `base_contracts` was slightly modified from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`. Additionally, `CAST(... AS INT)` was added around `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` in the `WHERE` clauses for `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs.
    *   **Further Refinements (1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM to 1/21/2026, 4:29:42 PM):** The `CAST(... AS INT)` was removed from the `WHERE` clauses of `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax`, reverting to `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)`. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE block, including its `LEFT JOIN` in `contract_tax_totals` and its contribution to `total_tax`, was consistently commented out and then re-commented out, indicating its removal or temporary deactivation from the tax calculation logic.
    *   **Final Reversion (1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM to 1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM):** The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter was commented out, effectively reactivating the original date range and `EXISTS` subquery logic for `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` and `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` in the `base_contracts` CTE. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remained commented out, and the reference to `ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total` in `contract_tax_totals` was also removed from the `total_tax` calculation.
    *   **Additional join in the final `SELECT` (1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM):** The final version of the query introduces three `LEFT JOIN` statements to bring in data from `deceased_contacts`, `contract_writers`, and `item_counts` into the main `SELECT` statement, based on `CONTRACT_ID` and `CREATED_BY` (for deceased contacts) or `rn` (for contract writers and deceased contacts) for proper aggregation and display.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` (1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM and 1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM, 1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM, 1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM):**
    *   This file is a service responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot.
    *   **Initial state (1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM):** The `syncPlotBoxData` method included a `dd($dealsBatch);` statement (a Laravel debug helper that dumps and dies) directly after populating the batch arrays, preventing the rest of the sync logic from executing.
    *   **Key change (1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM):** The `dd($dealsBatch);` line was removed from the `syncPlotBoxData` method, allowing the full contact, deal, and location association processing (`$this->processContacts(...)`) to proceed.
    *   **Reversion (1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM):** The `dd($dealsBatch);` line was reintroduced.
    *   **Final state (1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM):** The `dd($dealsBatch);` line remains in the code, indicating that the full sync process is still being short-circuited for debugging purposes.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM:** Introduction of a hardcoded contract number filter in `Contact.php`, temporarily disabling date range filtering.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** Reversion of the `Contact.php` SQL query to enable date range filtering again, by commenting out the hardcoded contract number.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** Removal of a `dd()` debug statement in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, allowing the sync process to complete.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM:** Reintroduction of the `dd()` debug statement in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM:** Addition of crucial `LEFT JOIN` clauses in the final `SELECT` of `Contact.php` to include `item_counts`, `contract_writers`, and `deceased_contacts` in the output.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**

*   **SQL Query Iteration:** The `Contact.php` file shows frequent modifications to a complex SQL query within the `getDataWithDateRange` method. This includes commenting/uncommenting specific filters (like date ranges vs. `CONTRACT_NUMBER`), adding/removing `CAST` operations, and commenting out entire CTEs (like `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`). This indicates an iterative development and debugging process for refining the data retrieval logic.
*   **Debugging with `dd()`:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` shows a pattern of adding and removing `dd($dealsBatch);` for debugging, which pauses execution and inspects the `$dealsBatch` variable. This suggests active debugging of the HubSpot synchronization logic.
*   **Focus on PlotBox Integration:** Both files are clearly part of an application integrating with "PlotBox" data, implying a system that processes and potentially syncs cemetery/funeral home management data to a CRM like HubSpot. The `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` and `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` also reinforce this.
*   **Snowflake Database:** The constant `const CONNECTION = 'snowflake';` and table names like `PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT` consistently indicate the use of Snowflake as the primary data source.
*   **Contract-related Data:** A significant portion of the SQL query in `Contact.php` focuses on retrieving detailed contract information, including owners, payment schedules, fees, and various types of purchased items (caskets, cremation products, ground, markers, etc.).
