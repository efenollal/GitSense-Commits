# Activity Summary for 1/14/2026

## 4:07:03 AM
The logs show active development on two PHP files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, both last modified on January 13, 2026.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   This file defines an Eloquent model for `Contact` within the `PlotBox` namespace, interacting with a Snowflake database. It includes relationships for `contractOwners` and `contracts`.
    *   A significant `getDataWithDateRange` static method is present, which executes a complex SQL query to retrieve contract, contact, contract writer, and item count data from various `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS` tables (e.g., `DIM_CONTRACT`, `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`, `DIM_CONTACT`, `DIM_CONTRACT_WRITER`, `DIM_SYSTEM_USER`, `DIM_CONTRACT_ITEM`, `DIM_FEE`, `DIM_FEE_CATEGORY`, `DIM_FACILITY`). The query aggregates item counts based on fee categories (caskets, cremation, ground, markers, mausoleum, niche, opening/closing, merchandise, services, private estates, urns, vaults).
    *   The `getHubspotData` method acts as a wrapper for `getDataWithDateRange`, fetching data for the current date.
    *   **Timestamp-specific changes:**
        *   **1/13/2026, 3:37:33 PM:** The initial log for this file shows the `getDataWithDateRange` method's `base_contracts` CTE contains a hardcoded filter `WHERE DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER IN('660-1004010262')` and comments out the date range filtering (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}'` and the `EXISTS` clause). The `SELECT` statement includes `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id`.
        *   **1/13/2026, 3:52:26 PM:** The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter is removed from `base_contracts`, and the date range filtering based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` and `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` for `DIM_CONTRACT` and `DIM_CONTACT` respectively is re-enabled. The `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` column is removed from the final `SELECT` list.
        *   **1/13/2026, 4:13:52 PM:** The date range filtering is commented out again, and the hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER IN ('660-1004010262')` is re-inserted. The `pc.CONTRACT_ID AS Contract_Id` column is re-added to the final `SELECT` list. This indicates a revert or testing of specific contract numbers.
        *   **1/13/2026, 4:15:07 PM:** The hardcoded contract number is changed to `'Draft-4157894'`.
        *   **1/13/2026, 4:23:10 PM:** No functional changes are observed from the previous version, indicating a potential save without code modification.
        *   **1/13/2026, 4:36:52 PM:** The hardcoded contract number is changed to `'Draft-4157884'`.
        *   **1/13/2026, 4:49:40 PM:** The hardcoded contract number is changed to `'623-1004011168'`.
        *   **1/13/2026, 5:00:46 PM:** The hardcoded contract number is changed back to `'660-1004010262'`.
        *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:30 PM:** The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter is finally removed, and the date range filtering (for `DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` and `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME`) is permanently uncommented and active again.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   This file defines a service for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot, handling contacts, deals, and locations. It utilizes `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`, `HubSpotRepositoryInterface`, and various HubSpot-specific services.
    *   The `syncPlotBoxData` method orchestrates the data synchronization, batching primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals. It includes error handling and logging.
    *   The `processContacts` method handles the searching, creation, and updating of contacts and deals in HubSpot, as well as associating them with locations. It uses `sleep` calls to introduce delays for HubSpot processing.
    *   **Timestamp-specific changes:**
        *   **1/13/2026, 4:15:17 PM:** The `syncPlotBoxData` method contains a `dd($primaryContactBatch);` statement, which is a Laravel helper for dumping a variable and terminating script execution, likely used for debugging.
        *   **1/13/2026, 4:52:09 PM:** The `dd($primaryContactBatch);` statement is changed to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`, indicating a shift in debugging focus from primary contacts to deceased contacts.
        *   **1/13/2026, 5:29:55 PM:** The `dd()` statement is removed entirely, suggesting that the debugging phase for this part of the code is complete.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   This file contains a mapper class responsible for transforming PlotBox data transfer objects into a format suitable for HubSpot CRM. It includes methods for mapping primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals.
    *   It defines constants for `RELATIONSHIP_TO_THE_DECEASED` and `LINK_TO_PLOTBOX_CONTRACT`.
    *   The `__construct` method initializes HubSpot owner and location services, and retrieves cached lists of owners and locations. It also sets configuration values for HubSpot lifecycle stages and pipelines.
    *   The `formatMappedFields` private method is crucial for data normalization, converting location codes to IDs, uppercasing states, standardizing relationship text, and mapping email to HubSpot owner IDs.
    *   **Timestamp-specific changes:**
        *   **1/13/2026, 5:31:00 PM:** This is the only log entry for this file, indicating that it was created or significantly updated at this time. It includes a `__destruct` method for cleanup and comprehensive mapping logic.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Timestamping:** All changes occurred on the same date, January 13, 2026, suggesting a focused development session.
*   **PlotBox Data Synchronization to HubSpot:** The overarching theme is the synchronization of data from a PlotBox source (presumably a data warehouse fed by PlotBox) to HubSpot CRM. This involves extracting data, mapping it to CRM-specific fields, and then pushing it to HubSpot.
*   **SQL Query Iterations:** In `Contact.php`, there's a clear pattern of repeatedly modifying the `WHERE` clause of the large SQL query within `getDataWithDateRange`. This involved toggling between hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filters (e.g., '660-1004010262', 'Draft-4157894', 'Draft-4157884', '623-1004011168') and the intended date range filtering. This suggests a debugging or testing process where specific contracts were targeted before enabling the general date-based filter.
*   **Debugging with `dd()`:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` file shows the use of `dd()` (dump and die) statements, which are common in Laravel for debugging. The change in the variable being dumped (`$primaryContactBatch` to `$deceasedContactBatch`) indicates an iterative debugging approach.
*   **Data Transformation and Normalization:** The `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php` file highlights the importance of data transformation, including email lookups for owner IDs, location ID lookups, case normalization (e.g., state to uppercase, pipeline to lowercase/normalized), and date formatting for epoch timestamps.
*   **Robust Error Handling and Logging:** Both `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` and `Contact.php` include `try-catch` blocks and `Log::error` statements, demonstrating an emphasis on capturing and reporting failures during data processing and API interactions.
*   **Explicit Database and Table Naming:** The SQL queries consistently reference fully qualified table names like `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTRACT`, indicating a clear data warehousing schema.
*   **HubSpot Object Types:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService` refers to `dealTypeIdForLocationsAssociations` and `contactTypeIdForLocationsAssociations` from configuration, indicating a structured approach to associating different HubSpot objects (contacts, deals) with locations.
