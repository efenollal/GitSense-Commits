# Activity Summary for 1/27/2026

## 12:38:00 AM
The following summarizes the key changes from the provided code log:

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` (Multiple timestamps from 1/21/2026 to 1/22/2026):**
    *   This file, a Laravel Eloquent Model for `Contact` within the `PlotBox` namespace, consistently defines database connection (`snowflake`), table (`PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT`), primary key (`CONTACT_KEY`), and fillable attributes.
    *   It includes Eloquent relationships for `contractOwners` (hasMany) and `contracts` (belongsToMany).
    *   The core of the changes revolve around the `getDataWithDateRange` static method, which executes a complex SQL query to retrieve contact and contract data from a Snowflake warehouse.
    *   **SQL Query Evolution:**
        *   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM (Initial State):** The `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause includes a date range filter on `DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` and `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME`, with a production-only `DIM_CONTRACT.STATUS = 'Approved'` filter. It also includes a `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and references `ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total` in `contract_tax_totals`.
        *   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM to 1/21/2026, 1:37:28 PM:** The primary date range filtering condition in the `base_contracts` CTE is commented out, replaced by a hardcoded `WHERE DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'`. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remains active and contributes to `contract_tax_totals`.
        *   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE is commented out, and its reference in `contract_tax_totals` (`COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)`) is also commented out (or removed, depending on interpretation of partial code). The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter remains.
        *   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:** Small change in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs: `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` was changed to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` and `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)` to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)`. This looks like a potential copy-paste error where `f.TAX_AMOUNT` should likely be used in `deed_fee_tax` as well.
        *   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM:** Corrected the `SUM` calculation in `deed_fee_tax` back to `SUM(df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)`. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remains commented out. Changed `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` (capital I).
        *   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:** Added `CAST(... AS INT)` around `SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts` in the `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (...)` and `WHERE df.CONTRACT_ID IN (...)` clauses of `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, and similarly for the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE.
        *   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM:** Changed the hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter in `base_contracts` from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.
        *   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM:** Removed `CAST(... AS INT)` around `SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts` in `deed_fee_tax` CTE (`WHERE df.CONTRACT_ID IN SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` -> likely a syntax error that was introduced). The `contract_fee_tax` CTE still has `CAST`.
        *   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM:** Corrected the syntax error in `deed_fee_tax` by removing `AS INT)` from `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)`. Also removed `CAST` from `contract_fee_tax`. So, the `CAST` operations added earlier were reverted.
        *   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM:** In `contract_tax_totals`, the `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` was uncommented, but `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remains commented out, leading to a potential SQL error.
        *   **1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM:** The `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` line in `contract_tax_totals` was commented out again.
        *   **1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM:** The `total_tax` calculation in `contract_tax_totals` was slightly rearranged for `COALESCE(cft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)`. It appears there was an attempt to add it back without the CTE being active, resulting in a syntax error (`//+ // COALESCE...`).
        *   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` filter was commented out, and the original date range filter on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` for `DIM_CONTRACT` and `DIM_CONTACT` was reinstated. The `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` in `contract_tax_totals` remains commented out.
        *   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM:** The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE block is completely removed from the SQL query (it was previously commented out). Consequently, its reference (`COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)`) is also removed from `contract_tax_totals`. The final `SELECT` statement also shows a complete set of joins for `df`, `cnp`, `cw`, `ic`.
    *   **Final `SELECT` clause in `getDataWithDateRange`:** Over the course of the changes, the `SELECT` clause consistently returns a wide array of contact, contract, and item-related fields, including calculated net price and aggregated item counts by category. The joins to `DIM_FACILITY`, `contract_net_prices`, `contract_writers`, and `item_counts` are present in all logs.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` (1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM to 1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM):**
    *   This service is responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot.
    *   The `syncPlotBoxData` method fetches data using `getDataForCrmSync`, maps it to CRM objects (`mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, `mapDeal`), and then processes them in batches.
    *   It uses `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, and `HubSpotLocationService` for CRM interactions.
    *   **Timestamp 1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM:** Includes a `dd($dealsBatch)` call, which would halt execution and dump the `dealsBatch` variable. This indicates a debugging step.
    *   **Timestamp 1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging line was removed.
    *   **Timestamp 1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging line was re-added.
    *   **Timestamp 1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` debugging line was removed again.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 1:37:28 PM:** Introduction and retention of a hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter in the SQL query within `Contact.php`, temporarily disabling the date range filter.
*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** Removal/commenting out of the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE in `Contact.php`, signifying a change in tax calculation logic or data source.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM & 4:16:07 PM:** Minor corrections to `SUM` aggregation logic and case sensitivity for `FEE_TYPE` in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM - 4:26:14 PM:** Introduction and subsequent removal/correction of `CAST(... AS INT)` statements for subqueries in `Contact.php`'s SQL, suggesting experimentation with data type handling.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM - 4:27:46 PM:** Brief re-introduction and then re-commenting/mis-handling of `cancelled_fee_tax_total` in `contract_tax_totals` in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** Reversion to the original date range filtering logic in `Contact.php`'s SQL, removing the hardcoded contract number.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** Removal of the `dd($dealsBatch)` debug statement in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM:** Final removal of `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE in `Contact.php`.
*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM & 11:25:42 AM:** Toggling of the `dd($dealsBatch)` debug statement in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`, indicating active debugging sessions.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent File Modification:** The `Contact.php` model is the primary target for changes, particularly its `getDataWithDateRange` method and the complex SQL query it contains. This suggests ongoing development or refinement of data retrieval for PlotBox contacts and contracts.
*   **SQL Query Refinement:** There's a clear pattern of iterative development and debugging within the embedded SQL query:
    *   Toggling between dynamic date filters and hardcoded contract IDs for testing.
    *   Commenting out/uncommenting/removing specific CTEs (e.g., `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`) and their references, indicating adjustments to how total tax or other financial metrics are calculated.
    *   Minor syntax adjustments and type casting experiments within the SQL.
*   **Debugging Practices:** The repeated addition and removal of `dd($dealsBatch)` in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` highlights a pattern of using `var_dump` or `die` style debugging during development.
*   **Data Synchronization Context:** Both files are related to a "datalink" project, with `Contact.php` serving as a data source from `PlotBox_WAREHOUSE` and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` handling the synchronization of this data to HubSpot, suggesting an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) or data integration pipeline.
*   **Snowflake Database:** The explicit `const CONNECTION = 'snowflake'` in `Contact.php` indicates the use of Snowflake as the data warehouse.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Both `Contact.php` (implicitly via `Log::error` in the service) and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` utilize `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log` for error reporting, indicating robust error handling in the application.
*   **Partial Code Logs:** Many entries for `Contact.php` end abruptly, indicated by `----------------------------------------`, which suggests the log is showing only a segment of the file, but the start and context of changes are usually clear.

## 1:37:57 AM
The provided log details changes across two PHP files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Changes occurred frequently between 1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM and 1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM.
    *   **Initial State (1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM):** The `getDataWithDateRange` method contains a complex SQL query. The `WHERE` clause in the `base_contracts` CTE filters records based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within a specified date range (`$fromDate` and `$toDate`). A `contractStatusFilter` is applied conditionally for 'production' environment. It also includes a `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE which is then used in `contract_tax_totals`.
    *   **Changes around 1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 1:37:28 PM:**
        *   The original date range filter in the `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause was commented out.
        *   A hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` filter was introduced in the `base_contracts` CTE, effectively limiting data retrieval to a specific contract for testing or debugging.
        *   The line `COALESCE(cnp.net_price, pc.TOTAL_CASH_PRICE, 0)` in the final `SELECT` statement was changed to `COALESCE(cnp.net_price, 0)`. This removes `pc.TOTAL_CASH_PRICE` as a fallback for `net_price`.
    *   **Changes around 1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM - 4:16:07 PM:**
        *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was commented out.
        *   Consequently, the `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` part was commented out in the `contract_tax_totals` CTE, removing the cancelled fees from the total tax calculation.
        *   A minor change in the `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` condition was made in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs: 'interest' became 'Interest' (capitalized 'I').
        *   A significant change was made to the `SUM` aggregation in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs: `SUM(f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` was changed to `SUM(cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY)` and `SUM(df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY)`, respectively. This implies `TAX_AMOUNT` is now expected on `DIM_CONTRACT_FEE` and `DIM_DEED_FEE` tables instead of `DIM_FEE`.
    *   **Changes around 1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM - 4:20:13 PM:**
        *   The `WHERE` clause in `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs was modified to include `CAST(... AS INT)` around `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)`.
        *   The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter in `base_contracts` was changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.
    *   **Changes around 1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM:**
        *   The `CAST(... AS INT)` was removed from `deed_fee_tax` CTE, and the subquery syntax was slightly altered (missing parentheses around the subquery). This is likely an error.
    *   **Changes around 1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM - 4:27:14 PM:**
        *   The `CAST(... AS INT)` in `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax` (and implicitly `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` if uncommented) was removed.
        *   The commented-out line `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` within the `total_tax` calculation in `contract_tax_totals` was further commented out or partially removed, suggesting a shift away from including cancelled fees in the tax total.
    *   **Changes around 1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM:**
        *   The `total_tax` calculation in `contract_tax_totals` was explicitly simplified to `COALESCE(cft.contract_fee_tax_total, 0) + COALESCE(dft.deed_fee_tax_total, 0)` with the `cancelled_fee_tax_total` line fully commented out.
    *   **Changes around 1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM - 4:32:48 PM:**
        *   The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` filter in `base_contracts` was commented out.
        *   The original date range filter based on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` between `$fromDate` and `$toDate` was restored, making the `getDataWithDateRange` method functional with date inputs again.
        *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE remained commented out, and its inclusion in `contract_tax_totals` also remained commented out.
    *   **Final change on 1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM - 11:25:33 AM:**
        *   The previously commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its reference in `contract_tax_totals` were completely removed, solidifying the exclusion of cancelled contract fees from total tax calculations.
        *   The final `SELECT` statement had its `LEFT JOIN` clauses fixed and extended to correctly join `item_counts`, `facility_dimension_details`, etc. This looks like a completion of the SQL query.

2.  **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM and 1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM, 11:24:34 AM, 11:25:42 AM.
    *   **Initial State (1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM):** This service handles syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot. It initializes various HubSpot services and a data mapper. The `syncPlotBoxData` method retrieves data, maps it, and then processes primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals, attempting to create associations.
    *   **Change at 1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** A `dd($dealsBatch)` line (Laravel's "dump and die" debugging function) was present after populating the batch arrays but before the actual processing logic. This line was removed, indicating the completion of a debugging phase and allowing the sync process to continue.
    *   **Subsequent changes at 1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM and 11:25:42 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` line reappears at the exact same location, indicating a reintroduction of debugging or an accidental revert/re-save. This suggests an iterative debugging cycle for the HubSpot sync logic.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Iterative Debugging and Refinement:** The `Contact.php` file shows a clear pattern of incrementally modifying a large SQL query. This includes:
    *   Commenting out and re-enabling date filters.
    *   Introducing and removing hardcoded contract numbers for specific testing.
    *   Commenting out and eventually removing a CTE (`cancelled_contract_fee_tax`) and its related calculations.
    *   Correcting column references for `TAX_AMOUNT` and `CONTRACT_ID` casting in SQL.
    *   Repeated partial saves of the file (`Contact.php`) with minor changes, often only a few seconds or minutes apart, especially during the 4:00 PM hour on 1/21/2026. This strongly suggests rapid development and testing cycles.
*   **HubSpot Integration Focus:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` file focuses on the data synchronization process with HubSpot, specifically handling contacts (primary and deceased), deals, and location associations. The `dd($dealsBatch)` appearance and disappearance further emphasizes active development and debugging of this integration.
*   **Data Transformation Logic:** Both files are deeply involved in data transformation. `Contact.php` defines the source data extraction (SQL query), while `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` uses a mapper (`PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`) to prepare this data for a CRM system (HubSpot).
*   **Robustness with Try-Catch:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` uses `try-catch` blocks extensively around different processing stages (primary contacts, deceased contacts, associations, deals, location associations) to ensure resilience and allow for partial processing even if certain steps fail.
*   **Logging:** `Log::error` and `Log::info` calls are consistently used in `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` for tracking execution and troubleshooting errors.
*   **Fixed Date:** All timestamps are consistently from 2026, specifically January 21st and 22nd, indicating changes made within a two-day period.

## 4:37:56 AM
The provided log details changes across two files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

**File-specific Updates:**

**1. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**

This file, representing an Eloquent Model for `Contact` in a PlotBox context, primarily saw modifications within its `getDataWithDateRange` static method, which executes a complex Snowflake SQL query.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM (Initial State):** The `WHERE` clause for `base_contracts` included a date range filter on `DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME`. It also included a commented-out section for `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` in the `contract_tax_totals` CTE.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM - 1/21/2026, 1:37:28 PM:** The primary change observed in these timestamps is the commenting out of the original date range filter in the `base_contracts` CTE's `WHERE` clause. It was replaced with a hardcoded filter: `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'`. This suggests a debugging effort focusing on a specific contract.

*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:** The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its inclusion in the `contract_tax_totals` calculation were commented out. This change was persistent in subsequent updates.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:** A minor change occurred in the `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs, where `f.TAX_AMOUNT` was changed to `cf.TAX_AMOUNT` and `df.TAX_AMOUNT` respectively. This indicates a correction in how tax amounts were being calculated, likely referencing the tax amount directly from the contract fee/deed fee table instead of the general fee table.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:16:07 PM:** The `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` condition was changed to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` in the `contract_fee_tax` CTE, indicating a case sensitivity correction. Similarly, `ccf.TAX_AMOUNT` was changed to `ccf.TAX_AMOUNT` (which appears to be a no-op if the CTE is commented out, but reflects the intended correction if it were active).

*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:** Casting `SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts` to `INT` was introduced within the `WHERE ... IN` clauses for `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTEs. This explicitly ensures the `CONTRACT_ID` is treated as an integer for comparison.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM:** The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter in `base_contracts` was changed from `'645-110814'` to `'110814'`.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM:** An error in the SQL syntax was introduced, where `IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` became `IN SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)`. This removed the parenthesis around the subquery in the `deed_fee_tax` CTE, which is likely a syntax error.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM:** The `CAST(... AS INT)` operations in the `WHERE ... IN` clauses were removed, reverting to `IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)`. The syntax error introduced at 4:23:56 PM for `deed_fee_tax` was also corrected, bringing back the parenthesis.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM:** A potential typo was introduced in the `contract_tax_totals` CTE, where `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` was uncommented, but the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE itself was still commented out. This would lead to a SQL error as `ccft` would not be defined.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM:** The problematic `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` in `contract_tax_totals` was commented out again, indicating a rollback of the previous change related to `cancelled_fee_tax_total`.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM:** Another similar change in `contract_tax_totals` occurred, where `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` was changed to `COALESCE(cft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)`, which is still problematic as `cft` only contains `contract_fee_tax_total`. This was immediately commented out.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:** The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` filter was commented out, and the original date range filter on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` for `DIM_CONTRACT` and `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` for `DIM_CONTACT` was uncommented and reinstated. This restores the intended dynamic date filtering for the `getDataWithDateRange` method.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM - 1/22/2026, 11:25:33 AM:** The SQL query was extended to include joins with `item_counts`, `contract_writers`, `deceased_contacts`, `contract_net_prices`, and `DIM_FACILITY` (`df`) in the final `SELECT` statement. This indicates an expansion of the data being retrieved, pulling in more details about contracts, items, writers, deceased contacts, net prices, and facility information. The previously commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its reference in `contract_tax_totals` remained commented out.

*   **1/22/2026, 2:29:50 PM:** The explicit contract number filter `//DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` was removed completely from the `base_contracts` WHERE clause. The original date-range based filtering logic, including the check for last updated dates in both `DIM_CONTRACT` and `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER` via `EXISTS`, is fully active. The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE and its inclusion in `contract_tax_totals` remained commented out.

**2. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**

This file is responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM (Initial State):** The `syncPlotBoxData` method includes a `dd($dealsBatch)` call, which would halt execution and dump the `$dealsBatch` variable. This is a common debugging practice.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` call was removed from the `syncPlotBoxData` method. This indicates the debugging step was completed and the code is now intended to run through the entire sync process.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` call was re-introduced. This suggests a renewed need for debugging the `$dealsBatch` data or a regression in the data processing flow.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch)` call was removed again. This implies the debugging related to `$dealsBatch` was once more completed.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging via Commenting/Hardcoding:** A significant pattern is the frequent use of commenting out dynamic date filters and temporarily replacing them with hardcoded contract numbers (`'645-110814'`, then `'110814'`) in the `Contact.php` model. This is a clear indication of ongoing development and debugging of the complex SQL query.
*   **SQL Query Refinement:** The `Contact.php` file shows continuous refinement of the embedded SQL query, particularly around tax calculations (changing `f.TAX_AMOUNT` to `cf.TAX_AMOUNT`/`df.TAX_AMOUNT`), case sensitivity (`'interest'` to `'Interest'`), and intermittent attempts to manage "cancelled contract fee tax" which eventually remains commented out.
*   **Data Expansion in SQL Query:** Over time, the final `SELECT` statement in `Contact.php` was expanded to include more detailed information from various CTEs (Common Table Expressions) and joined tables (e.g., `item_counts`, `contract_writers`, `deceased_contacts`, `DIM_FACILITY`). This suggests an evolution in the data requirements for the `getDataWithDateRange` method.
*   **HubSpot Sync Debugging:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` file shows repeated cycles of adding and removing `dd($dealsBatch)` for debugging purposes. This suggests active development and troubleshooting of the HubSpot data synchronization logic, specifically concerning the deal data preparation.
*   **Consistent File Modification:** The `Contact.php` file was modified very frequently within a short period, especially on 1/21/2026, indicating intensive work on its core data retrieval logic.
*   **Future Timestamps:** All timestamps are set to 2026, which is in the future relative to the current date (early 2024). This suggests the logs might be from a simulated environment, a development branch with placeholder dates, or a project with a very long development cycle.

## 6:37:58 AM
The provided log details changes across two PHP files: `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` and `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`.

### File-Specific Updates:

**1. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` (Multiple timestamps from 1/21/2026 to 1/22/2026)**

This file, representing an Eloquent model for `Contact` within a PlotBox namespace, underwent numerous, highly iterative changes, primarily focusing on its `getDataWithDateRange` static method. This method executes a complex Snowflake SQL query to retrieve contract and contact information.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:51:05 PM (Initial State):** The query in `getDataWithDateRange` included a `WHERE` clause for `base_contracts` that filtered by `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` and `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within a specified date range. It also included sub-queries for `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`, and `contract_tax_totals` summed all three.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:52:00 PM to 1/21/2026, 1:37:28 PM:**
    *   The `WHERE` clause in the `base_contracts` CTE was commented out and replaced with a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'`. This suggests a debugging or testing phase where a specific contract was targeted.
    *   The overall structure of the large SQL query, including numerous Common Table Expressions (CTEs) like `base_contracts`, `payment_schedule_totals`, `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`, `contract_tax_totals`, `contract_net_prices`, `contract_writers`, `item_counts`, `primary_contacts`, and `deceased_contacts`, remained consistent throughout these entries.
    *   The `SELECT` statement in the main query, which joins these CTEs and selects various contact and contract details, also remained largely unchanged in terms of the fields being selected.

*   **1/21/2026, 3:57:10 PM:**
    *   The `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE was entirely commented out.
    *   Consequently, the `contract_tax_totals` CTE was updated to remove the reference to `ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total` from its `COALESCE` sum. This indicates a decision to exclude cancelled contract fee tax from the total tax calculation.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:05:53 PM:**
    *   A minor but critical change in `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax` CTEs: the `SUM` calculation was updated from `f.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY` to `cf.TAX_AMOUNT * cf.QUANTITY` and `df.TAX_AMOUNT * df.QUANTITY` respectively. This indicates a correction in how tax amounts were being referenced (likely from `f` (fee) to `cf` (contract fee) or `df` (deed fee) for the `TAX_AMOUNT` column). The commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` also had its `SUM` updated to `ccf.TAX_AMOUNT * ccf.QUANTITY` in preparation if it were to be uncommented.
    *   The `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'interest'` condition was changed to `LOWER(f.FEE_TYPE) != 'Interest'` in `contract_fee_tax`, indicating a case-sensitivity correction for the 'Interest' fee type.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:08 PM:**
    *   The `WHERE` clauses for `CONTRACT_ID` in `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented-out `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` were modified. `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` was changed to `(CAST(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT))`. This suggests an explicit type casting was deemed necessary or beneficial for the `CONTRACT_ID` subquery.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:20:13 PM:**
    *   The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '645-110814'` filter in `base_contracts` was changed to `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'`, removing the '645-' prefix.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:23:56 PM:**
    *   Attempted to remove the inner `SELECT` for `CONTRACT_ID` entirely within the `WHERE` clauses of `contract_fee_tax`, `deed_fee_tax`, and `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`. For instance, `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` became `WHERE cf.CONTRACT_ID IN (SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)`. This change was syntax-incorrect (the `AS INT` was applied to the subquery itself rather than the selected column within it).

*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:14 PM:**
    *   Corrected the syntax error from the previous commit, reverting `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts AS INT)` back to `(SELECT CONTRACT_ID FROM base_contracts)` in the `WHERE` clauses of `contract_fee_tax` and `deed_fee_tax`, and the commented `cancelled_contract_fee_tax`. The explicit `CAST` was removed.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:26:47 PM:**
    *   The `contract_tax_totals` CTE was further modified. The commented-out `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` was uncommented, but `ccft` was likely a typo as `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE itself was still commented out. It instead referenced `cft.cancelled_fee_tax_total`, which is incorrect as `cft` refers to `contract_fee_tax`. This looks like a mistake introduced during rapid iteration.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:14 PM:**
    *   Reverted the incorrect change in `contract_tax_totals`, commenting out `COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0)` again. This effectively removed the `cancelled_fee_tax_total` from the `total_tax` calculation and kept the `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` CTE commented out.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:27:46 PM:**
    *   Removed an extra `AS total_tax` from the `contract_tax_totals` CTE's `SELECT` statement (it had `... as total_tax //+ // COALESCE(ccft.cancelled_fee_tax_total, 0) AS total_tax` previously). It now correctly has only one `AS total_tax`.

*   **1/21/2026, 4:31:12 PM:**
    *   The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '110814'` filter in `base_contracts` was commented out, restoring the original date range filtering logic for `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` and `DIM_CONTACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME`. This returns the query to its intended functional state of filtering by date range instead of a specific contract number.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:20 AM:**
    *   The last remaining commented-out blocks related to `cancelled_contract_fee_tax` and its inclusion in `contract_tax_totals` were fully removed from the code, suggesting a final decision to omit this calculation.
    *   The main `SELECT` statement at the very end of the SQL query was significantly expanded and completed. Previously, it was cut short with `... COALESCE(ic.other_services_owned, 0)`, now it includes all `item_counts` fields (`Other_Services_Owned`, `Private_Estates_Owned`, `Urns_Owned`, `Vaults_Owned`) and adds `LEFT JOIN` clauses to connect `primary_contacts` with `deceased_contacts`, `contract_writers`, `item_counts`, `contract_net_prices`, and `DIM_FACILITY` (`df`). This marks a major completion of the SQL query.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:25:33 AM & 1/22/2026, 11:24:43 AM:** These timestamps represent minor, likely cosmetic or whitespace-related changes, as the core logic from the 11:24:20 AM commit is preserved and complete.

**2. `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` (Multiple timestamps from 1/21/2026 to 1/22/2026)**

This file, responsible for syncing PlotBox data to HubSpot, saw a recurring modification pattern.

*   **1/21/2026, 12:54:56 PM (Initial State):** The `syncPlotBoxData` method contains a `dd($dealsBatch);` statement. This is a Laravel `dump and die` function, typically used for debugging, which would halt execution and display the contents of `$dealsBatch`.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:19:31 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was removed from the `syncPlotBoxData` method. This indicates that the debugging step related to `$dealsBatch` was completed, and the code was ready to proceed with the full contact and deal processing.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:24:34 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was re-introduced into the `syncPlotBoxData` method, exactly as it was in the earliest log entry for this file. This suggests a re-introduction of the debugging step, possibly due to further issues or for verification after changes elsewhere.

*   **1/22/2026, 11:25:42 AM:** The `dd($dealsBatch);` statement was removed again, returning the file to the state where full data synchronization would run without interruption.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Iterative SQL Query Refinement:** The `PlotBox\Contact.php` file shows a strong pattern of iterative refinement of a single, complex SQL query within the `getDataWithDateRange` method. This included commenting/uncommenting sections for debugging or temporary exclusion, hardcoding and then reverting contract number filters, fixing syntax in `CAST` operations, and correcting column references for tax calculations.
*   **Debugging with `dd()`:** The `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` file repeatedly demonstrates the use of `dd($dealsBatch);` for debugging purposes, adding it to halt execution and inspect data, and then removing it to allow the full sync process to run. This indicates an active development and testing cycle.
*   **Timestamp Proximity:** Many changes to `PlotBox\Contact.php` occurred in rapid succession (e.g., several within minutes on 1/21/2026 from 4:05 PM to 4:31 PM), highlighting quick development iterations and immediate fixes.
*   **Focus on Data Synchronization:** Both files are integral to a data synchronization process: `Contact.php` handles data extraction from a Snowflake warehouse, and `PlotBoxHubSpotService.php` processes this data for CRM (HubSpot) integration. The changes reflect efforts to correctly extract, calculate, and prepare this data.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Both files include `try-catch` blocks and `Log::error` calls, indicating a robust approach to error handling and monitoring within the application.
*   **Database and ORM Usage:** `PlotBox\Contact.php` uses Laravel's Eloquent ORM features for basic model definition and relationships, but the `getDataWithDateRange` method directly uses `DB::connection(self::CONNECTION)->select()` for complex raw SQL queries on a Snowflake database, suggesting specific data extraction requirements not easily met by Eloquent's query builder.
