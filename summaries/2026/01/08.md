# Activity Summary for 1/8/2026

## 12:53:51 AM
The logs show a series of code changes primarily focused on integrating with the HubSpot CRM, alongside the addition of a new data model for PlotBox.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotContactService.php` (Timestamps: 1/2/2026, 11:41:48 AM; 12:01:48 PM; 12:03:11 PM; 12:16:54 PM)**
    *   **Initial Commit (11:41:48 AM):** Introduced the `HubSpotContactService` implementing `CrmContactInterface`. It provides core functionalities for creating, updating, and associating contacts in HubSpot. Key methods include `createContact`, `updateContact`, and `associatePrimaryAndDeceasedContacts`. It systematically removes certain properties (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `service_type_code`) before sending data to HubSpot and includes robust logging with specific error handling for API exceptions and general exceptions, ensuring batch operations continue even if individual items fail. It also loads association type IDs from configuration.
    *   **Debugging Interventions (12:01:48 PM & 12:03:11 PM):** A `dd($apiToken);` statement was temporarily added to the constructor for debugging the API token, and then subsequently removed.
    *   **Type Hinting Refinement (12:16:54 PM):** The constructor's `apiToken` parameter was updated to accept a nullable string (`?string`), and `source` to a strict string (`string`), improving type safety.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotDealService.php` (Timestamps: 1/2/2026, 11:41:59 AM; 12:17:50 PM)**
    *   **Initial Commit (11:41:59 AM):** Introduced `HubSpotDealService` implementing `CrmDealInterface`. It offers methods to `createDeal`, `updateDeal`, and `associateDealWithContact` in HubSpot. Similar to the Contact service, it preprocesses deal data by unsetting properties (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `hmis_account_number`) and uses comprehensive error logging that allows batch processing to continue despite individual failures. It also fetches deal-to-contact association type and search configuration from system settings.
    *   **Type Hinting Refinement (12:17:50 PM):** The constructor's `apiToken` parameter was updated to accept a nullable string (`?string`), and `source` to a strict string (`string`), enhancing type safety.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotLocationService.php` (Timestamps: 1/2/2026, 11:42:16 AM; 12:17:39 PM)**
    *   **Initial Commit (11:42:16 AM):** Added `HubSpotLocationService` for managing custom 'Location' objects in HubSpot. It includes functionalities to retrieve location IDs by code, determine association type IDs (with caching), and associate contacts or deals with locations using specific user-defined association types. It also contains a `batchAssociateWithLocation` method designed to handle associations in chunks and prevent rate limiting. Error logging is extensive, capturing full response details on API failures.
    *   **Type Hinting Refinement (12:17:39 PM):** The constructor's `apiToken` parameter was updated to accept a nullable string (`?string`), and `source` to a strict string (`string`).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotOwnerService.php` (Timestamps: 1/2/2026, 11:43:42 AM; 12:17:13 PM)**
    *   **Initial Commit (11:43:42 AM):** Introduced `HubSpotOwnerService` for retrieving HubSpot owner information. It includes methods to `getOwnersList` (all owners) and `getOwnerByEmailAddress`, with error handling and logging for API exceptions.
    *   **Type Hinting Refinement (12:17:13 PM):** The constructor's `apiToken` parameter was updated to accept a nullable string (`?string`), and `source` to a strict string (`string`).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Providers\HubSpotServiceProvider.php` (Timestamps: 1/2/2026, 11:47:45 AM; 12:00:29 PM)**
    *   **Initial Setup (11:47:45 AM):** Established the `HubSpotServiceProvider` responsible for binding HubSpot-related services for different data sources (`plotbox` and `hmis`). It configures `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService`, injecting instances of `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, and an `EloquentHubSpotRepository` specific to each source's data model (`PlotBox\Contact` and `Hmis\Sale`). A `dd($hmisToken);` was present in the `HmisHubSpotService` binding.
    *   **Debugging Artifact Removal (12:00:29 PM):** The `dd($hmisToken);` debugging statement was removed.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` (Timestamp: 1/6/2026, 3:15:57 PM)**
    *   **New Model Introduction:** A new Eloquent model `Contact` was created under the `PlotBox` namespace. It connects to the `snowflake` database, targets the `DIM_CONTACT` table, and defines relationships to `ContractOwner` and `Contract`. The most substantial part is the `getDataWithDateRange` method, which executes a complex SQL query to retrieve comprehensive contact and contract data, including details for both primary and deceased contacts, contract writers, and various item counts, all filtered by `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or associated contact's `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME`. A `getHubspotData` wrapper method is provided for fetching today's data. Logging is included to display the first query result.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\config\services.php` (Timestamp: 1/2/2026, 12:08:26 PM)**
    *   This file, which contains configuration sourced from environment variables, is present in the log but is not summarized to adhere to security guidelines. It defines various HubSpot API settings, association type IDs, object type IDs, lifecycle stages, deal pipelines, and source-specific API access tokens and data properties for HMIS and PlotBox.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HubSpot API Integration:** The majority of the changes revolve around building a comprehensive integration layer for HubSpot's CRM, covering contacts, deals, locations (custom objects), and owners.
*   **Consistent Error Handling:** All HubSpot service classes employ a standardized `try-catch` block structure for API calls, differentiating between `ApiException` (HubSpot-specific errors) and generic `Exception` (unexpected errors). Logging is consistently used to record details of operations and failures, often allowing batch processes to continue gracefully.
*   **Configuration-Driven Approach:** Association type IDs, object type IDs, and various service configurations are consistently fetched from `config('services.hubspot.*')`, centralizing the management of HubSpot-related settings.
*   **Data Cleansing:** The `create` and `update` methods in `HubSpotContactService` and `HubSpotDealService` explicitly `unset` specific properties (e.g., `loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`) from incoming data, indicating a common requirement to filter out internal system properties before syncing to HubSpot.
*   **Debugging Cycle:** The brief appearance and removal of `dd()` statements in both a Service Provider and a Service class constructor indicate an active debugging process during the development phase on `1/2/2026`.
*   **Type Safety Improvement:** A pattern emerged around `1/2/2026, ~12:17 PM` where the constructors of all HubSpot services were updated to include nullable and strict type hints (`?string`, `string`), suggesting a push for improved code quality and robustness.
*   **Source-Specific Data Handling:** The `HubSpotServiceProvider` and the new `PlotBox\Contact` model highlight the architecture's ability to handle data from different internal sources (PlotBox, HMIS) and map it to HubSpot, often with source-specific configurations and data extraction logic.
*   **Complex SQL Queries for Data Extraction:** The `PlotBox\Contact` model demonstrates the use of a sophisticated SQL query to gather and combine data from multiple tables, indicating a need for detailed, aggregated information from the source system for CRM synchronization.

## 4:53:51 AM
The primary focus of these changes is the enhancement and refinement of HubSpot CRM integration services, alongside detailed data extraction and preparation from a PlotBox source.

**File-Specific Updates:**

    *   **Timestamp: 1/2/2026, 11:42:16 AM**: This file introduces a service for managing HubSpot custom location objects and their associations. Key methods include `getLocationIdByCode` for searching locations, `getAssociationTypeId` which utilizes caching, and association methods like `associateContactToLocation`, `associateDealToLocation`, and `batchAssociateWithLocation`. The batch association method incorporates a small delay (`usleep`) to prevent rate limiting.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/2/2026, 12:17:39 PM**: The constructor signature was updated to make the `$apiToken` parameter nullable (`?string`).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotOwnerService.php`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/2/2026, 11:43:42 AM**: This service interacts with HubSpot owner objects. It provides `getOwnersList` to retrieve all CRM owners and `getOwnerByEmailAddress` to find a specific owner. Error handling and logging are consistently applied across these methods.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/2/2026, 12:17:13 PM**: The constructor signature was changed to accept a nullable `$apiToken` (`?string`).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Providers\HubSpotServiceProvider.php`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/2/2026, 11:47:45 AM**: This service provider is responsible for binding and configuring HubSpot-related services in the application's dependency injection container. It sets up `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService`, injecting instances of `HubSpotContactService` and `HubSpotDealService` along with an `EloquentHubSpotRepository`. A debugging `dd($hmisToken);` call was temporarily present.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/2/2026, 12:00:29 PM**: The temporary `dd($hmisToken);` debugging statement was removed.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\config\services.php`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/2/2026, 12:08:26 PM**: This configuration file received significant updates related to HubSpot. It now centralizes numerous HubSpot association type IDs, lifecycle stages, pipeline IDs, object type IDs, and deal stages, all sourced from environment variables. Crucially, it defines detailed `deal_search_config` for different sources ('hmis', 'plotbox'), specifying search properties and properties to fetch. Furthermore, `sources` configurations for 'hmis' and 'plotbox' were added, outlining API access tokens, ID properties, phone properties, and a comprehensive list of contact properties to be synchronized.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/6/2026, 3:15:57 PM**: This file defines an Eloquent model for PlotBox contacts, configured to connect to a Snowflake database. It introduces complex SQL queries within the `getDataWithDateRange` method to extract and transform extensive contract and contact details. This query aggregates information including primary contacts, deceased contacts, contract writers, and counts of various purchased items (caskets, cremation products, markers, etc.). The data is filtered by `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` to retrieve recently updated records. A `getHubspotData` wrapper method is also provided for fetching today's data.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HubSpot Ecosystem Integration**: There's a comprehensive effort to integrate various HubSpot CRM functionalities (contacts, deals, locations, owners) into the application.
*   **Consistent Error Handling and Logging**: All HubSpot service classes demonstrate a consistent pattern of `try-catch` blocks to handle API-specific and general exceptions, coupled with detailed logging, indicating a focus on robustness and diagnostic capabilities.
*   **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Before interacting with the HubSpot API, relevant service methods (`createContact`, `updateContact`, `createDeal`, `updateDeal`) consistently remove or unset specific properties from the data, suggesting a data normalization or filtering requirement.
*   **Object Associations**: A strong emphasis is placed on establishing and managing associations between different HubSpot objects (contacts, deals, locations), utilizing both user-defined and HubSpot-defined association types.
*   **Configuration Externalization**: Extensive use of `config('services.hubspot...')` and environment variables is evident in `config/services.php` and service constructors, promoting flexible and environment-aware configuration.
*   **Nullable API Tokens**: A recent pattern, observed across four HubSpot service constructors, is the change to make the `$apiToken` parameter nullable (`?string`), potentially to support scenarios where the token might be optionally provided or handled differently.
*   **Debugging Practices**: The brief inclusion and removal of `dd()` statements in both a service provider and a service class constructor highlight an active development and debugging process.
*   **Source-Specific Data Handling**: The `config/services.php` and `HubSpotServiceProvider` demonstrate a clear strategy to manage data from multiple sources (HMIS, PlotBox) with source-specific configurations and data models.
*   **Complex Data Extraction**: The `PlotBox\Contact` model reveals a sophisticated data extraction process involving complex SQL queries and joins across multiple tables to prepare data for CRM synchronization, often focusing on `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` for incremental updates.

## 5:53:45 AM
The code changes primarily focus on enhancing and refining HubSpot integration services, specifically for contacts, deals, and locations, across different data sources (PlotBox and HMIS). There's also an update to a model for data retrieval.

**File-specific updates and timestamps:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotContactService.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:41:48 AM:** Initial comprehensive implementation of `HubSpotContactService`. This service handles creating, updating, and associating contacts in HubSpot. Key methods include `createContact`, `updateContact`, and `associatePrimaryAndDeceasedContacts`. It extracts properties to be removed (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `service_type_code`) before sending data to HubSpot. Robust error logging with `Log::error` is present for API exceptions and general exceptions. Association types for "next of kin" and "contact to deal" are loaded from configuration.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotDealService.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:41:59 AM:** Initial implementation of `HubSpotDealService`. This service provides functionalities for creating, updating, and associating deals with contacts in HubSpot. Methods like `createDeal`, `updateDeal`, and `associateDealWithContact` are defined. Similar to contacts, it removes specific properties (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `hmis_account_number`) before API calls. It also includes extensive logging for operations and error handling.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:17:50 PM:** The constructor's `$apiToken` parameter type hint was changed from `string` to `?string` (nullable string), aligning with the change in `HubSpotContactService`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotLocationService.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:42:16 AM:** Initial implementation of `HubSpotLocationService`. This service manages HubSpot custom location objects and their associations. It includes methods for `getLocationIdByCode`, `getAssociationTypeId` (with caching), `associateContactToLocation`, `associateDealToLocation`, and `batchAssociateWithLocation`. It defines constants for cache keys, TTL, batch size, and association types. The service extensively logs association attempts and errors.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:17:39 PM:** The constructor's `$apiToken` parameter type hint was changed from `string` to `?string` (nullable string), aligning with other HubSpot services.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotOwnerService.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:43:42 AM:** Initial implementation of `HubSpotOwnerService`. This service retrieves HubSpot owner information. It has methods `getOwnersList` to fetch all owners and `getOwnerByEmailAddress` to find a specific owner. Error handling is included for HubSpot API exceptions and general exceptions.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:17:13 PM:** The constructor's `$apiToken` parameter type hint was changed from `string` to `?string` (nullable string), aligning with other HubSpot services.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Providers\HubSpotServiceProvider.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:47:45 AM:** The `HubSpotServiceProvider` was updated to bind `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` to the application container. It configures these services with their respective `HubSpotContactService` and `HubSpotDealService` instances, using specific API tokens and Eloquent repositories for different data models (`\App\Models\PlotBox\Contact::class`, `\App\Models\Hmis\Sale::class`). A `dd($hmisToken)` debugging line was present in the `HmisHubSpotService` binding.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:00:29 PM:** The debugging `dd($hmisToken)` line was removed from the `HmisHubSpotService` binding.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **1/6/2026, 3:15:57 PM:** A significant update to the `Contact` Eloquent model. It now defines a Snowflake connection, table name, and primary key. New relationships (`contractOwners`, `contracts`) were added. The most substantial change is the `getDataWithDateRange` static method, which executes a complex SQL query to retrieve contract and contact data from PlotBox's Snowflake warehouse. This query joins multiple tables (`DIM_CONTRACT`, `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`, `DIM_CONTACT`, `DIM_CONTRACT_WRITER`, `DIM_SYSTEM_USER`, `DIM_CONTRACT_ITEM`, `DIM_FEE`, `DIM_FEE_CATEGORY`, `DIM_FACILITY`) to gather detailed information about contracts, primary contacts, deceased contacts, deal writers, and item counts (caskets, cremation products, ground, markers, etc.) within a specified date range. It also includes `getHubspotData` as a wrapper for daily data retrieval.

**Patterns and recurring elements:**

1.  **HubSpot API Integration:** All services (`HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`, `HubSpotOwnerService`) extensively use the `HubSpot\Factory::createWithAccessToken($apiToken)` to initialize the HubSpot client, demonstrating a consistent approach to API authentication.
2.  **Configuration-driven IDs:** Association type IDs and object type IDs (e.g., `nextOfKinContactAssociationTypeId`, `contactToDealAssociationTypeId`, `locationObjectType`, `dealToLocationAssociationTypeId`, `contactToLocationAssociationTypeId`) are consistently loaded from `config('services.hubspot...')`, promoting configurable and maintainable API interactions.
3.  **Robust Error Handling & Logging:** A prevalent pattern across all HubSpot services is the use of `try...catch (ApiException $e)` and `try...catch (Exception $e)` blocks, followed by detailed error logging using `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log::error`. This ensures that API-specific errors and unexpected general exceptions are captured, often including response bodies and stack traces, facilitating debugging and operational monitoring.
4.  **Property Removal before API Calls:** The contact and deal services explicitly `unset` specific properties (e.g., `'loc_id'`, `'last_update_dt'`, `'exists'`, `'service_type_code'`, `'hmis_account_number'`) from the data payload before sending it to the HubSpot API. This suggests a pattern of filtering internal/unwanted properties from external API requests.
5.  **Nullable API Token:** The change to `?string $apiToken` in the constructors of `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`, and `HubSpotOwnerService` indicates a potential architectural shift to allow these services to be instantiated without an API token in certain contexts (perhaps for testing or scenarios where the token is retrieved dynamically later).
6.  **Service Provider Bindings:** `HubSpotServiceProvider` consistently binds specific HubSpot services (PlotBox and HMIS) by injecting `HubSpotContactService` and `HubSpotDealService` instances along with an `EloquentHubSpotRepository`, indicating a modular and dependency-injected design for integrating different data sources with HubSpot.
7.  **Complex SQL Queries for Data Extraction:** The `PlotBox\Contact` model demonstrates a pattern of using intricate raw SQL queries (leveraging CTEs) on a Snowflake database to prepare comprehensive datasets for HubSpot synchronization, covering various aspects of contracts and associated entities.
8.  **Debugging `dd()` statements:** Temporary `dd()` statements (e.g., in `HubSpotServiceProvider` and `HubSpotContactService`) appeared and were subsequently removed, indicating active development and debugging cycles.

*   **January 2, 2026, between 11:47 AM and 12:00 PM:** Debugging activity in `HubSpotServiceProvider.php` with a `dd()` statement added and then removed.
*   **January 2, 2026, between 12:01 PM and 12:03 PM:** Brief debugging in `HubSpotContactService.php` with a `dd()` statement added and removed.
*   **January 2, 2026, 12:08:26 PM:** A major update to `config/services.php`, centralizing HubSpot integration parameters.
*   **January 2, 2026, between 12:16 PM and 12:17 PM:** Consistent updates across all HubSpot service `__construct` methods to add scalar type hints, specifically for `apiToken` and `source`.
*   **January 6, 2026, 3:15:57 PM:** A substantial update to `PlotBox\Contact.php`, introducing complex data retrieval logic tailored for HubSpot synchronization.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HubSpot Integration Focus:** The bulk of the changes centers on robust integration with the HubSpot CRM, covering contacts, deals, locations (custom objects), and owners.
*   **Service Layer Architecture:** A clear service-oriented design is evident, with dedicated classes for each HubSpot entity, promoting modularity and reusability.
*   **Centralized Configuration:** The `config/services.php` file acts as a single source of truth for all HubSpot-related settings, making the integration highly configurable and environment-aware.
*   **Comprehensive Logging:** All HubSpot service classes heavily utilize `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log` for both informational messages (`Log::info`) and error reporting (`Log::error`), often including detailed context (e.g., account numbers, API responses).
*   **Consistent Error Handling:** Methods in HubSpot services consistently use `try-catch` blocks to handle HubSpot API exceptions (`ContactsApiException`, `DealsApiException`, `AssociationsApiException`, `ObjectsApiException`, `OwnersApiException`) and general `Exception`s, ensuring that processing continues where possible and errors are logged.
*   **Property Filtering for APIs:** A recurring pattern in contact and deal creation/update methods is the removal of specific internal properties (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `service_type_code`, `hmis_account_number`) that should not be sent to the HubSpot API.
*   **Object Association Management:** A strong emphasis is placed on creating and managing associations between different HubSpot objects (e.g., contacts to contacts, deals to contacts, contacts to locations, deals to locations) using `AssociationSpec` and configurable `associationTypeId` values.
*   **Debugging Artifacts:** The temporary `dd()` statements in `HubSpotServiceProvider.php` and `HubSpotContactService.php` indicate an active development and debugging phase during the listed period.
*   **Improved Type Safety:** The consistent addition of scalar type hints (`?string`, `string`) to constructor methods across multiple HubSpot service classes suggests a move towards better code quality and type safety.
*   **Complex Data Sourcing for Sync:** The `PlotBox\Contact` model demonstrates a pattern of executing complex database queries to aggregate and prepare data from a data warehouse for subsequent synchronization with HubSpot. This includes filtering by `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC`, implying an incremental sync strategy.

    *   **1/2/2026, 11:41:48 AM**: Initial implementation of `HubSpotContactService`, defining methods for `createContact`, `updateContact`, and `associatePrimaryAndDeceasedContacts`. It handles HubSpot API interactions, error logging, and property filtering (removing `loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `service_type_code`). It uses `HubSpot\Factory` for client creation and retrieves association type IDs from configuration.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:01:48 PM**: A debugging `dd($apiToken);` statement was temporarily added to the constructor.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:03:11 PM**: The debugging `dd($apiToken);` statement was removed from the constructor. The file content reverted to its state at 11:41:48 AM.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:16:54 PM**: The constructor signature for `$apiToken` was updated to `?string $apiToken` making the API token nullable, and the type for `$source` was explicitly set to `string`.

    *   **1/2/2026, 11:41:59 AM**: Initial implementation of `HubSpotDealService`, providing `createDeal`, `updateDeal`, and `associateDealWithContact` functionalities. Similar to the Contact Service, it handles property filtering (removing `loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `hmis_account_number`) and uses `HubSpot\Factory`.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:17:50 PM**: The constructor signature for `$apiToken` was updated to `?string $apiToken` making the API token nullable, and the type for `$source` was explicitly set to `string`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotLocationService.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:42:16 AM**: Initial implementation of `HubSpotLocationService` for managing location objects in HubSpot. It includes methods for `getLocationIdByCode`, `getAssociationTypeId`, `associateContactToLocation`, `associateDealToLocation`, and `batchAssociateWithLocation`. It leverages caching for association types and defines constants for cache key, TTL, batch size, and association types. Extensive logging and exception handling are present.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:17:39 PM**: The constructor signature for `$apiToken` was updated to `?string $apiToken` making the API token nullable, and the type for `$source` was explicitly set to `string`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotOwnerService.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:43:42 AM**: Initial implementation of `HubSpotOwnerService` for retrieving HubSpot owner lists and specific owners by email. It includes error logging for API exceptions and general exceptions.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:17:13 PM**: The constructor signature for `$apiToken` was updated to `?string $apiToken` making the API token nullable, and the type for `$source` was explicitly set to `string`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Providers\HubSpotServiceProvider.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:47:45 AM**: This service provider was introduced to bind `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` to the application container, injecting `HubSpotContactService` and `HubSpotDealService` instances with specific API tokens and source identifiers ('plotbox' or 'hmis'). A `dd($hmisToken);` debugging statement was present.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:00:29 PM**: The debugging `dd($hmisToken);` statement was removed from the `HmisHubSpotService` binding.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\config\services.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:08:26 PM**: This configuration file was significantly expanded to include comprehensive HubSpot service settings. This includes API URL, various association type IDs (contact-to-contact, contact-to-deal, next-of-kin, location associations), lifecycle stages, pipeline IDs, and object type IDs. It also defines `deal_search_config` for 'hmis' and 'plotbox' sources, specifying search properties and properties to fetch. Detailed source-specific configurations (`hmis`, `plotbox`) are added, including API access tokens (retrieved from environment variables), ID properties, phone properties, and a list of contact properties to sync.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **1/6/2026, 3:15:57 PM**: This file defines an Eloquent model for `Contact` from a Snowflake warehouse (`PLOTBOX_WAREHOUSE.WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_CONTACT`). It includes relationships and a static method `getDataWithDateRange` which executes a complex SQL query to retrieve contract and contact data, including associated writers, item counts, primary contacts, and deceased contacts, filtered by a date range. It logs the first query result. A wrapper `getHubspotData` fetches data for the current date.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:29:41 AM - 1/8/2026, 11:10:18 AM**: Multiple small, incremental changes occurred primarily within the SQL query inside the `getDataWithDateRange` method (which was renamed to `getDataWithDateRange1` for some commits, while the original `getDataWithDateRange` was modified with commented out sections or specific contract numbers for testing).
        *   **1/8/2026, 10:29:41 AM**: Added `LIMIT 1` to the main `SELECT` statement in `getDataWithDateRange`.
        *   **1/8/2026, 10:31:58 AM**: Added `df.FACILITY_ID AS Facility_ID, df.FACILITY_NAME AS Facility_Name` to the main `SELECT` statement and a `LEFT JOIN WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_FACILITY df ON pc.FACILITY_KEY = df.FACILITY_KEY`.
        *   **1/8/2026, 10:33:02 AM**: The `LEFT JOIN DIM_FACILITY df ON pc.FACILITY_KEY = df.FACILITY_KEY` was updated to refer to `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_FACILITY`.
        *   **1/8/2026, 10:35:05 AM**: Introduced a duplicate function `getDataWithDateRange` (the previous one was renamed `getDataWithDateRange1`), with the new `getDataWithDateRange` containing commented-out date range filters and a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '660-1004010262'` clause, seemingly for targeted debugging.
        *   **1/8/2026, 10:52:47 AM**: The duplicate `getDataWithDateRange` function (with debugging clauses) was removed, effectively restoring the state before 10:35:05 AM, but retaining the `LIMIT 1` and `DIM_FACILITY` join.
        *   **1/8/2026, 10:55:03 AM**: The debugging `getDataWithDateRange` function was re-added with `WWITH base_contracts` typo. Removed `bc.CREATED_BY_KEY` from `base_contracts` selection.
        *   **1/8/2026, 10:55:38 AM**: Fixed the `WWITH` typo back to `WITH`. Re-added `DIM_CONTRACT.CREATED_BY_KEY` to `base_contracts`.
        *   **1/8/2026, 11:00:21 AM**: No functional change, seems like a save operation.
        *   **1/8/2026, 11:04:46 AM**: Renamed the original `getDataWithDateRange` back to `getDataWithDateRange1` and reintroduced the duplicate `getDataWithDateRange` function with commented-out blocks, similar to 10:35:05 AM, but without the hardcoded contract number for the new `getDataWithDateRange`.
        *   **1/8/2026, 11:04:55 AM**: The `getDataWithDateRange1` function was removed, leaving only one `getDataWithDateRange` function which now functions as the primary one, returning to a state similar to the initial 1/6/2026 commit with the `DIM_FACILITY` join and `LIMIT 1`. The join `DIM_FACILITY df ON pc.FACILITY_KEY = df.FACILITY_KEY` was also updated to `SUBSTRING(CAST(pc.CONTACT_KEY AS STRING), 1, 3) AS Location_Cd` in the `SELECT` list, removing the `DIM_FACILITY` join from the main query.
        *   **1/8/2026, 11:05:24 AM - 11:11:00 AM**: Multiple commits appear to revert the previous change, re-adding the `DIM_FACILITY` join and `df.FACILITY_SHORT_NAME AS Location_Cd` (and `Facility_ID`, `Facility_Name`) to the main `SELECT` statement. There were also temporary reintroductions and removals of a duplicate `getDataWithDateRange1` function for testing.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:18:21 AM**: Significant changes in join conditions within the SQL query, particularly in `primary_contacts` and `deceased_contacts` CTEs. `bc.CREATED_BY_KEY` changed to `bc.CREATED_BY`, and `dco.CREATED_BY_KEY` to `dco.CREATED_BY`. Also changed `dc.CONTACT_KEY` to `dc.CONTACT_ID` in `dco` join conditions for `DIM_CONTACT`. `DIM_CONTRACT.FACILITY_KEY` was changed to `DIM_CONTRACT.FACILITY_ID` in `base_contracts` and `primary_contacts`. The join to `DIM_FACILITY` also changed `pc.FACILITY_KEY` to `pc.FACILITY_ID`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:19:46 AM**: Minor adjustments to the join conditions in `primary_contacts` and `deceased_contacts` CTEs related to `dco.CONTACT_ID` and `dc.CONTACT_KEY` but seem to revert part of the 11:18:21 AM change related to `dc.CONTACT_ID` back to `dc.CONTACT_KEY` for one part of the join. The `contract_writers` CTE also changed `cw.CONTRACT_KEY` to `cw.CONTRACT_ID` in its `SELECT` and `PARTITION BY` clauses.
    *   **1/8/2026, 12:23:40 PM**: Further adjustments to join conditions in `item_counts` CTE (from `fee.FEE_KEY = ci.FEE_KEY` to `fee.FEE_ID = ci.FEE_ID` and `fc.FEE_CATEGORY_KEY = fee.FEE_CATEGORY_KEY` to `fc.FEE_CATEGORY_ID = fee.FEE_CATEGORY_ID`). The `CONTRACT_KEY` column in `item_counts` `GROUP BY` and `WHERE` clauses changed to `CONTRACT_ID`. The `contract_writers` CTE now uses `cw.USER_ID` instead of `cw.USER_KEY`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 12:25:13 PM - 1:03:44 PM**: Continuous refinement of the SQL query. Key changes include:
        *   `primary_contacts` and `deceased_contacts` CTEs now select `dco.CREATED_BY` and `dc.CONTACT_ID` to be used in `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses for row numbering, and the main `SELECT` statement now includes `pc.CREATED_BY AS Created_By_Key`.
        *   Join conditions involving `CREATED_BY` and `CONTACT_ID` were refined to ensure correct association.
        *   The main `SELECT` statement now orders by `pc.CONTRACT_ID` instead of `pc.CONTRACT_KEY`.
        *   The `getDataWithDateRange1` method (the duplicate testing one) was removed, and the single `getDataWithDateRange` method has become the canonical one with all the refined SQL.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **1/2/2026, 11:41:48 AM - 11:43:42 AM**: Initial setup of core HubSpot CRM service classes (`Contact`, `Deal`, `Location`, `Owner`).
*   **1/2/2026, 11:47:45 AM**: Introduction of `HubSpotServiceProvider` for dependency injection configuration.
*   **1/2/2026, 12:08:26 PM**: Comprehensive HubSpot service configuration added to `config/services.php`.
*   **1/2/2026, 12:16:54 PM - 12:17:50 PM**: Harmonization of constructor signatures across HubSpot service classes, making `apiToken` nullable.
*   **1/6/2026, 3:15:57 PM**: First appearance of the `PlotBox\Contact` model with its complex SQL query.
*   **1/8/2026, 10:29:41 AM - 1:03:44 PM**: A series of rapid, iterative changes and debugging attempts focused on refining the Snowflake SQL query within `PlotBox\Contact` model, particularly concerning join keys (`CONTACT_KEY` vs. `CONTACT_ID`, `CREATED_BY_KEY` vs. `CREATED_BY`) and the inclusion of facility-related data. The use of temporary duplicate methods (`getDataWithDateRange1`) and commented-out sections indicates active development and testing of the SQL query.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **HubSpot API Integration**: All `HubSpot` service files (Contact, Deal, Location, Owner) consistently use `HubSpot\Factory::createWithAccessToken($apiToken)` for API client instantiation. They all implement logging for actions (create, update, associate) and error handling for `ApiException` and general `Exception`s, ensuring robustness.
*   **Configuration-Driven**: Association type IDs and other HubSpot-specific identifiers are consistently loaded from `config('services.hubspot...')`, promoting configurable and maintainable code.
*   **Property Filtering**: `createContact` and `updateContact` methods in `HubSpotContactService` and `HubSpotDealService` consistently remove specific properties (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `service_type_code`, `hmis_account_number`) before sending data to HubSpot, suggesting a need to clean or transform data.
*   **SQL Query Refinement (PlotBox Contact Model)**: The `PlotBox\Contact` model shows a recurring pattern of modifications to its Snowflake SQL query, specifically around the join conditions (`CONTACT_KEY`, `CONTACT_ID`, `CREATED_BY_KEY`, `CREATED_BY`, `FACILITY_KEY`, `FACILITY_ID`) and the inclusion/exclusion of `DIM_FACILITY` table, indicating an ongoing effort to correctly retrieve and structure data for HubSpot sync from the PlotBox warehouse. The use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) like `base_contracts`, `contract_writers`, `item_counts`, `primary_contacts`, and `deceased_contacts` is a consistent structural element of this query.
*   **Debugging Practices**: The presence of `dd()` (dump and die) statements and temporary duplicate methods (`getDataWithDateRange1`, `getDataWithDateRange2`) with commented-out code or hardcoded values suggests a direct, iterative debugging approach during development.
*   **Nullable API Tokens**: A recent pattern emerged to make API tokens nullable in the constructors of HubSpot service classes (`?string $apiToken`), indicating a potential change in how these services are instantiated or a need to handle cases where an API token might not be immediately available.
