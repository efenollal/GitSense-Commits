# Activity Summary for 1/9/2026

## 10:20:37 AM
The provided log details changes primarily focused on HubSpot integration services and a data retrieval model for PlotBox contacts.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotContactService.php`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Initial significant changes occurred around `1/2/2026, 11:41:48 AM`, with subsequent minor modifications until `1/2/2026, 12:03:11 PM`.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   The constructor of `HubSpotContactService` was updated to include a `dd($apiToken);` call (`1/2/2026, 12:01:48 PM`), which was then removed (`1/2/2026, 12:03:11 PM`). This suggests a debugging step was temporarily added and then reverted.
        *   The type hint for the `$apiToken` parameter in the constructor was changed from `string` to `?string` (nullable string) around `1/2/2026, 12:16:54 PM`, allowing `null` to be passed for the API token.
        *   The class implements `CrmContactInterface` and handles creating, updating, and associating contacts in HubSpot. It logs various stages and errors in these processes. It also explicitly unsets certain properties (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `service_type_code`) before sending data to HubSpot.
        *   A `TODO` comment is present in the `associatePrimaryAndDeceasedContacts` method, suggesting future refactoring to separate the association logic.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotDealService.php`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Key changes occurred around `1/2/2026, 11:41:59 AM` and `1/2/2026, 12:17:50 PM`.
    *   **Changes:**

        *   The class implements `CrmDealInterface` and provides methods for `createDeal`, `updateDeal`, and `associateDealWithContact`.
        *   It removes properties (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `hmis_account_number`) before creating or updating deals in HubSpot.
        *   Detailed logging is present for all operations, including error codes, messages, and response bodies for API failures.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotLocationService.php`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Changes were recorded around `1/2/2026, 11:42:16 AM` and `1/2/2026, 12:17:39 PM`.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   The constructor's `$apiToken` parameter type hint was updated to `?string` (nullable string) around `1/2/2026, 12:17:39 PM`.
        *   This service manages HubSpot location objects, including retrieving IDs by code, associating contacts and deals with locations, and batch associations.
        *   It uses a cache for association type IDs to reduce repeated API calls.
        *   Extensive error logging is implemented, providing detailed context for association failures.
        *   A constant `BATCH_SIZE` of 100 is defined for batch operations, with a `100ms` delay to prevent rate limiting.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotOwnerService.php`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Changes occurred around `1/2/2026, 11:43:42 AM` and `1/2/2026, 12:17:13 PM`.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   The constructor's `$apiToken` parameter type hint was changed to `?string` (nullable string) around `1/2/2026, 12:17:13 PM`.
        *   This service provides functionality to retrieve a list of HubSpot owners and to search for an owner by email address.
        *   Error logging is included for API failures and empty email addresses.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Providers\HubSpotServiceProvider.php`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Two updates were recorded on `1/2/2026` at `11:47:45 AM` and `12:00:29 PM`.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   The `dd($hmisToken);` debugging statement in the `HmisHubSpotService` binding was removed, indicating the completion of a debugging phase.
        *   The service provider binds `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` to the application container, injecting `HubSpotContactService` and `HubSpotDealService` instances with source-specific API tokens and Eloquent repositories.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **Timestamp:** A series of frequent, incremental changes occurred between `1/6/2026, 3:15:57 PM` and `1/8/2026, 1:18:19 PM`.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   This Eloquent model is responsible for retrieving PlotBox contact data from a Snowflake warehouse.
        *   The primary method `getDataWithDateRange` (and its variants like `getDataWithDateRange1`, `getDataWithDateRange2`) executes a complex SQL query involving multiple CTEs (`base_contracts`, `contract_writers`, `item_counts`, `primary_contacts`, `deceased_contacts`) to gather comprehensive contact and contract-related information.
        *   The SQL query was repeatedly refined and debugged, as evidenced by the multiple commits. Specific changes include:
            *   Adding `LIMIT 1` to the main `SELECT` statement for debugging purposes (`1/8/2026, 10:29:41 AM` onwards). This was likely used to quickly check query output without fetching large datasets.
            *   Temporarily commenting out date range filters and introducing a specific `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter for debugging specific contracts (`1/8/2026, 10:45:21 AM`). This was also part of debugging the query logic.
            *   Changes in join conditions within the CTEs, specifically relating `CREATED_BY_KEY` to `CREATED_BY` and `CONTACT_KEY` to `CONTACT_ID` in `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER` and `DIM_CONTACT` tables, and `FEE_KEY` to `FEE_ID` and `FEE_CATEGORY_KEY` to `FEE_CATEGORY_ID` in `DIM_CONTRACT_ITEM`, `DIM_FEE`, and `DIM_FEE_CATEGORY` tables. This indicates a refactoring or correction of the table relationships in the SQL query logic (`1/8/2026, 11:18:21 AM` to `1/8/2026, 1:18:19 PM`).
            *   Introduction of `Facility_ID` and `Facility_Name` in the final `SELECT` statement and corresponding `LEFT JOIN DIM_FACILITY` on `pc.FACILITY_KEY = df.FACILITY_KEY` (`1/8/2026, 10:31:58 AM`), later modified to `pc.FACILITY_ID = df.FACILITY_ID` (`1/8/2026, 11:19:46 AM`).
            *   Addition of `Created_By_Key` to the final `SELECT` statement (`1/8/2026, 1:03:44 PM`).
        *   A `getHubspotData` static method is provided as a wrapper to call `getDataWithDateRange` for the current date.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **HubSpot API Integration:** All services under `App\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot` (Contact, Deal, Location, Owner) share a common structure for interacting with the HubSpot API:
    *   They use `HubSpot\Factory::createWithAccessToken($apiToken)` in their constructors.
    *   They interface with specific HubSpot CRM APIs (e.g., `contacts()->basicApi()->create`).
    *   They define association type IDs via `config('services.hubspot....')`.
    *   They consistently implement robust error logging with `Log::error` and `Log::info`, including error codes, messages, and response bodies, making debugging and monitoring easier.
    *   They frequently remove specific internal properties (e.g., `loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`) before sending data to HubSpot, indicating a filtering mechanism for properties not relevant to the CRM.
    *   The parameter `$apiToken` in constructors was consistently updated to `?string`, indicating a shift to explicitly allow nullable API tokens.

2.  **Date-Range Data Retrieval:** The `PlotBox\Contact` model heavily focuses on fetching data within a date range (`$fromDate`, `$toDate`) using complex SQL queries against a Snowflake database.

3.  **SQL Query Refinement:** The `PlotBox\Contact` model's SQL query underwent iterative changes, primarily concerning:
    *   Debugging specific filters (e.g., `LIMIT 1`, specific `CONTRACT_NUMBER`).
    *   Adjusting join conditions (e.g., `CREATED_BY_KEY` vs. `CREATED_BY`, `CONTACT_KEY` vs. `CONTACT_ID`, `FEE_KEY` vs. `FEE_ID`). This suggests resolving data model discrepancies or optimizing joins.
    *   Adding or modifying selected columns (e.g., `FACILITY_ID`, `FACILITY_NAME`, `CREATED_BY_KEY`).

4.  **Logging:** `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log` is extensively used across all modified files for debugging and operational monitoring, providing insights into data being processed, API responses, and errors.

5.  **Dependency Injection:** `HubSpotServiceProvider` demonstrates the use of Laravel's service container to bind and resolve HubSpot-related services, injecting dependencies like `HubSpotContactService` and `HubSpotDealService` with their respective API tokens.

## 11:21:11 AM
The log details significant updates across several PHP files related to HubSpot CRM integration, specifically concerning contact, deal, and location management, along with changes in data mapping and service provisioning.

    *   **Timestamp: 1/2/2026, 11:42:16 AM**: Initial creation or a major update. This service manages HubSpot custom location objects, including `getLocationIdByCode`, `getAssociationTypeId` (with caching), `associateContactToLocation`, `associateDealToLocation`, and `batchAssociateWithLocation`. It explicitly logs API errors with full response bodies for association failures.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/2/2026, 12:17:39 PM**: The constructor's `$apiToken` parameter type hint was changed from `string` to `?string`, making it nullable.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotOwnerService.php`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/2/2026, 11:43:42 AM**: Initial creation or a major update. This service interacts with HubSpot's owner API to `getOwnersList` and `getOwnerByEmailAddress`, with error handling and logging for API exceptions.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/2/2026, 12:17:13 PM**: The constructor's `$apiToken` parameter type hint was changed from `string` to `?string`, making it nullable.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Providers\HubSpotServiceProvider.php`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/2/2026, 11:47:45 AM**: The service provider configures the binding for `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService`. A `dd($hmisToken);` debugging statement was added within the `HmisHubSpotService` binding.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/2/2026, 12:00:29 PM**: The `dd($hmisToken);` debugging statement was removed from the `HmisHubSpotService` binding, restoring the original functionality.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\config\services.php`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/2/2026, 12:08:26 PM**: This configuration file was updated to include a comprehensive `hubspot` section. This section defines various HubSpot API URL, association type IDs (e.g., `contact_to_contact_association_type_id`, `deal_to_contact_association_type_id`, `next_of_kin_contact_association_type_id`, `contact_to_location_association_type_id`, `deal_to_location_association_type_id`), lifecycle stages, pipelines, custom object type IDs for locations and deals, and `deal_search_config` for both 'hmis' and 'plotbox' sources. It also outlines `sources` configuration for 'hmis' and 'plotbox', including API access tokens, ID properties, phone properties, and a list of properties to fetch.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/6/2026, 3:15:57 PM**: An Eloquent model for PlotBox contacts was added or significantly updated. It defines relationships (`contractOwners`, `contracts`) and includes a static method `getDataWithDateRange` which executes a complex Snowflake SQL query. This query joins multiple PlotBox warehouse tables (`DIM_CONTRACT`, `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`, `DIM_CONTACT`, `DIM_CONTRACT_WRITER`, `DIM_SYSTEM_USER`, `DIM_CONTRACT_ITEM`, `DIM_FEE`, `DIM_FEE_CATEGORY`, `DIM_FACILITY`) to extract detailed information about primary contacts, deceased contacts, contract writers, and item counts, filtered by a date range. It also has a `getHubspotData` wrapper method.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/8/2026, 10:29:41 AM**: The `getDataWithDateRange` method was modified to add a `LIMIT 1` clause to the main `SELECT` statement in the SQL query.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/8/2026, 10:31:58 AM**: The main SQL query in `getDataWithDateRange` had a `LEFT JOIN` added to `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_FACILITY df ON pc.FACILITY_KEY = df.FACILITY_KEY` and two new columns `df.FACILITY_ID AS Facility_ID` and `df.FACILITY_NAME AS Facility_Name` were added to the final select statement.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/8/2026, 10:33:02 AM**: The `LEFT JOIN` to `DIM_FACILITY` in `getDataWithDateRange` was reverted to `LEFT JOIN DIM_FACILITY df ON pc.FACILITY_KEY = df.FACILITY_KEY`, removing the `WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.` prefix. The added `Facility_ID` and `Facility_Name` columns were also removed from the final `SELECT`. This looks like a temporary change for testing that was reverted.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/8/2026, 10:40:26 AM**: Reverted previous changes; `DIM_FACILITY` join reverted to `LEFT JOIN WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_FACILITY df ON pc.FACILITY_KEY = df.FACILITY_KEY`, and `Facility_ID`, `Facility_Name` columns were re-added to the final `SELECT`.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/8/2026, 10:45:21 AM**: The `getDataWithDateRange` method was renamed to `getDataWithDateRange1`, and a new `getDataWithDateRange` method was added. The new `getDataWithDateRange` includes commented-out date range filters and a hardcoded contract number `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '660-1004010262'`, indicating a debugging or specific test case.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/8/2026, 10:52:47 AM**: Reverted changes made at 10:45:21 AM, removing the `getDataWithDateRange1` method and restoring the original `getDataWithDateRange` with dynamic date filters, but keeping the `LIMIT 1` and `DIM_FACILITY` join.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/8/2026, 10:55:03 AM - 1/8/2026, 11:06:38 AM**: Multiple small, rapid changes and reverts occurred, mostly involving commented out SQL clauses or minor adjustments to join conditions (`bc.CREATED_BY_KEY` to `bc.CREATED_BY`). The `getDataWithDateRange` method was also renamed to `getDataWithDateRange1` temporarily and then reverted, demonstrating iterative testing of the SQL query logic.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/8/2026, 11:09:22 AM - 1/8/2026, 11:11:00 AM**: Continued minor modifications to join conditions in the SQL query within `getDataWithDateRange` (or `getDataWithDateRange1`). Specifically, `SUBSTRING(CAST(pc.CONTACT_KEY AS STRING), 1, 3) AS Location_Cd` was added, implying an extraction of location code from `CONTACT_KEY`.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/8/2026, 11:18:21 AM - 1/8/2026, 1:18:19 PM**: A series of changes to the SQL query's `JOIN` conditions, particularly around `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER` and `DIM_CONTACT` tables, shifting from `CONTACT_KEY` to `CONTACT_ID` or `CREATED_BY` for joining, suggesting attempts to correct or optimize data relationships. For example, `dco.CONTACT_KEY = dc.CONTACT_KEY` was changed to `dco.CONTACT_ID = dc.CONTACT_KEY` and `bc.CREATED_BY_KEY = dco.CREATED_BY_KEY` to `bc.CREATED_BY = dco.CREATED_BY`. The `CONTRACT_KEY` and `CONTRACT_ID` were also swapped in several `JOIN` conditions and `SELECT` aliases. The `getDataWithDateRange1` method was intermittently present and then removed, indicating experimental changes. The final update reverted the method name to `getDataWithDateRange` and focused on refining the join conditions using `CONTRACT_ID` and `CREATED_BY`.

*   **`\response_fd37b194-620b-4981-a320-76fc5f36551b\0` (implied `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`)**
    *   **Timestamp: 1/9/2026, 11:14:12 AM**: A new mapper class `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` was created. It initializes `HubSpotOwnerService` and `HubSpotLocationService` in its constructor, fetching lists of owners and locations. It defines constants for HubSpot lifecycle stages, deal stages, and pipelines. It provides `mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, and `mapDeal` methods to transform `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` into HubSpot-compatible data. Notably, `mapContact` has a phone number priority logic (landline over mobile) and conditionally adds `date_of_birth`. `mapDeceasedContact` also conditionally adds `date_of_birth` and `date_of_death` and sets a specific `lifecyclestage`. Both contact mapping methods use `formatMappedFields` to standardize values like state, relationship, pipeline, and resolve HubSpot owner/location IDs. A `isValidDate` helper method ensures valid dates. It also includes `mergePreNeedItemCountsToPrimaryContact` to add item counts for pre-need deals.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/9/2026, 11:15:29 AM**: A minor change was made in `mapContact` where the `phoneNumber` variable assignment logic was removed. Instead, `phone` property is directly assigned `trim($plotBoxDto->phone2)` and `mobilephone` gets `trim($plotBoxDto->phone1)`. Also, the conditional check for `isValidDate($plotBoxDto->dateOfBirth)` was removed in `mapDeceasedContact`, directly setting `date_of_birth` and `date_of_death` without validation.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/9/2026, 11:15:37 AM**: No functional change compared to the previous entry (11:15:29 AM). The code appears identical.
    *   **Timestamp: 1/9/2026, 11:20:17 AM**: Reverted a change from 11:15:29 AM; the conditional `isValidDate` check was re-added for `primaryDateOfBirth` in `mapContact`. A similar conditional check was also re-added for `deceasedBirthDate` and `deceasedDeathDate` in `mapDeceasedContact`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **1/2/2026, 11:41:48 AM - 11:43:42 AM**: Initial development or major overhauls of core HubSpot service classes (`HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`, `HubSpotOwnerService`) and the `HubSpotServiceProvider`.
*   **1/2/2026, 12:08:26 PM**: Comprehensive update to `config\services.php` to centralize HubSpot-related configuration, including various association IDs, pipelines, stages, and data source mappings. This suggests a significant effort to standardize HubSpot integration parameters.
*   **1/2/2026, 12:16:54 PM - 12:17:50 PM**: A series of minor but consistent updates across all HubSpot service constructors, changing the `$apiToken` parameter type hint to `?string` (nullable string), indicating a move towards more flexible API token handling (e.g., allowing null for internal testing or specific scenarios).
*   **1/6/2026, 3:15:57 PM**: Introduction of a complex SQL query within `PlotBox\Contact.php` to fetch aggregated contract and contact data for HubSpot. This marks a new or significantly expanded data extraction logic.
*   **1/8/2026, 10:29:41 AM - 1:18:19 PM**: Frequent, iterative changes and reverts in `PlotBox\Contact.php`, primarily focused on refining the complex SQL query's `JOIN` conditions, `SELECT` aliases, and column usage (`FACILITY_KEY` vs `FACILITY_ID`, `CONTACT_KEY` vs `CONTACT_ID`, `CREATED_BY_KEY` vs `CREATED_BY`). This suggests intensive debugging and optimization of the data retrieval for PlotBox integration.
*   **1/9/2026, 11:14:12 AM**: Introduction of `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`, indicating the establishment of a dedicated data transformation layer for PlotBox data destined for HubSpot CRM.
*   **1/9/2026, 11:15:29 AM - 11:20:17 AM**: Rapid iterative changes in `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php` around date validation and phone number mapping logic, showing fine-tuning of the data preparation before sending to HubSpot.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HubSpot API Integration**: All PHP service files (`HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`, `HubSpotOwnerService`) are dedicated to interacting with the HubSpot API, implementing specific CRM functionalities (contacts, deals, locations, owners). They consistently use `HubSpot\Factory::createWithAccessToken()` for client creation and include robust `try-catch` blocks for API exceptions and general errors, logging detailed messages.
*   **Configuration-Driven**: Services retrieve various IDs and configurations (e.g., association type IDs, lifecycle stages, deal pipelines, object type IDs) from the `config('services.hubspot...')` settings, highlighting a centralized and flexible configuration approach.
*   **Data Transformation/Sanitization**: Before sending data to HubSpot, both contact and deal services explicitly `unset` properties like `loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, and `hmis_account_number`/`service_type_code`, indicating a pattern of cleaning or filtering data to match HubSpot's API requirements. The `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` further standardizes fields like `state`, `pipeline`, and resolves owner/location IDs.
*   **Debugging and Iteration**: The `dd()` statements in `HubSpotServiceProvider` and `HubSpotContactService`, and the frequent small changes/reverts in `PlotBox\Contact.php` and `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`, particularly within SQL queries and mapping logic, strongly suggest an active development and debugging phase. The multiple `getDataWithDateRange` versions and commented-out SQL conditions in `PlotBox\Contact.php` also reinforce this.
*   **Data Sourcing (PlotBox)**: The `PlotBox\Contact.php` model is a critical data source, utilizing a complex Snowflake SQL query to aggregate data from various warehouse tables. This query is designed to extract comprehensive contract, contact (primary and deceased), writer, and itemized product information, which is then mapped to HubSpot.
*   **Nullable API Tokens**: The consistent change to `?string $apiToken` in service constructors indicates an allowance for nullable API tokens, potentially for environments where tokens might be missing or dynamically provided.

## 12:21:13 PM
The logs detail changes across several PHP files related to HubSpot CRM integration, primarily focusing on contact, deal, and location management, along with a HubSpot service provider and a PlotBox contact model. The changes span from January 2nd, 2026, to January 9th, 2026.

    *   **1/2/2026, 12:17:13 PM**: The constructor's `apiToken` parameter type hint was changed from `string` to `?string`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Providers\HubSpotServiceProvider.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:47:45 AM**: Content for the `HubSpotServiceProvider` class, responsible for binding various HubSpot services (`PlotBoxHubSpotService`, `HmisHubSpotService`) to the application container. It injects `HubSpotContactService` and `HubSpotDealService` with source-specific API tokens and Eloquent repositories. A `dd($hmisToken)` debugging statement was present in the `HmisHubSpotService` binding.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:00:29 PM**: The `dd($hmisToken)` debugging statement was removed from the `HmisHubSpotService` binding.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\config\services.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:08:26 PM**: This configuration file defines various third-party service credentials and settings, including extensive HubSpot configurations. It specifies API URLs, numerous association type IDs (e.g., `contact_to_contact_association_type_id`, `deal_to_location_association_type_id`), lifecycle stages, pipelines, and object type IDs. It also includes `deal_search_config` and `sources` configurations for HMIS and PlotBox, detailing API access tokens, ID properties, phone properties, and a list of properties to sync. A "TODO" comment indicates future refactoring for moving some configurations.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **1/6/2026, 3:15:57 PM**: This file introduces the `Contact` Eloquent model for PlotBox data, connecting to a Snowflake database. It defines `fillable` attributes and Eloquent relationships. The `getDataWithDateRange` static method executes a complex SQL query to retrieve contract and contact data, including primary and deceased contacts, contract writers, and item counts, filtering by `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` or `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` within a given date range. It also includes a `getHubspotData` wrapper method. A `Log::info` statement logs the first query result.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:29:41 AM**: A `LIMIT 1` clause was added to the main SQL query in `getDataWithDateRange`. This was likely for debugging to limit the output.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:31:58 AM**: A `LEFT JOIN WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_FACILITY df ON pc.FACILITY_KEY = df.FACILITY_KEY` was added to the main `SELECT` statement in `getDataWithDateRange`, and `df.FACILITY_ID AS Facility_ID, df.FACILITY_NAME AS Facility_Name` were added to the selected columns. The `LIMIT 1` clause remained.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:33:02 AM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:35:05 AM**: The `getDataWithDateRange` method was renamed to `getDataWithDateRange1`, and a new `getDataWithDateRange` method was introduced. The new method contains a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '660-1004010262'` filter, and the original date range and `EXISTS` conditions were commented out, suggesting a specific debugging or testing scenario.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:52:47 AM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:54:27 AM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:55:03 AM**: A typo `WWITH` was introduced at the start of the `base_contracts` CTE in the *new* `getDataWithDateRange` method, effectively making the query invalid. The `CREATED_BY_KEY` column was removed from the `DIM_CONTRACT` selection in the `base_contracts` CTE.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:55:38 AM**: The `WWITH` typo was corrected to `WITH`. The previous change regarding `CREATED_BY_KEY` remains.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:00:21 AM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:04:46 AM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:04:55 AM**: The `getDataWithDateRange1` method was removed. The single `getDataWithDateRange` method now uses `SUBSTRING(CAST(pc.CONTACT_KEY AS STRING), 1, 3) AS Location_Cd` instead of joining `DIM_FACILITY` to get `Location_Cd`. The `DIM_FACILITY` join was removed, and `FACILITY_ID` and `FACILITY_NAME` were removed from the `SELECT` list.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:05:24 AM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:06:38 AM**: The `getDataWithDateRange` method was renamed to `getDataWithDateRange2`. The `getDataWithDateRange1` method was added back with the original, broader date range logic and `DIM_FACILITY` join, but also includes the `LIMIT 1` clause. The old (now `getDataWithDateRange2`) method also still had the hardcoded contract number.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:09:22 AM**: The `getDataWithDateRange2` method was removed. The `getDataWithDateRange1` method remains with the date filtering and `LIMIT 1`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:10:18 AM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:10:53 AM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:11:00 AM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:18:21 AM**: The `JOIN` conditions in `primary_contacts` and `deceased_contacts` CTEs were altered, changing `dco.CREATED_BY_KEY = bc.CREATED_BY_KEY` and `dco.CREATED_BY_KEY = dc.CREATED_BY_KEY` to `bc.CREATED_BY = dco.CREATED_BY` and `dco.CREATED_BY = dc.CREATED_BY` respectively. Also, the `DIM_CONTRACT.FACILITY_KEY` in `base_contracts` was changed to `DIM_CONTRACT.FACILITY_ID`. The join for `DIM_FACILITY` in the final `SELECT` now uses `pc.FACILITY_ID = df.FACILITY_ID`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:19:46 AM**: The `JOIN` condition `dco.CONTACT_ID = dc.CONTACT_KEY` was changed to `dco.CONTACT_ID = dc.CONTACT_KEY` (no effective change, but explicitly shown). `dco.CONTRACT_ID = DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_KEY` was added to `EXISTS` subquery. In `primary_contacts` and `deceased_contacts`, `dco.CONTACT_KEY = dc.CONTACT_KEY` was changed to `dco.CONTACT_ID = dc.CONTACT_KEY`. In `contract_writers` and `item_counts`, `CONTRACT_KEY` in `IN` clause and `GROUP BY` was changed to `CONTRACT_ID`. The final join `cw ON pc.CONTRACT_KEY = cw.CONTRACT_KEY` was changed to `cw ON pc.CONTRACT_KEY = cw.CONTRACT_ID`. These changes appear to be fixing inconsistent key usage (CONTACT\_KEY vs CONTACT\_ID, CONTRACT\_KEY vs CONTRACT\_ID) across different tables.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:42:34 AM**: The `JOIN` condition `dco.CONTRACT_ID = DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_KEY` was changed to `dco.CONTRACT_ID = DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_ID`. Also, `dco.CONTACT_KEY = dc.CONTACT_KEY` in `EXISTS` was changed to `dco.CONTACT_ID = dc.CONTACT_KEY`. More consistency fixes between `_KEY` and `_ID` fields.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:44:53 AM**: The `JOIN` condition `dco.USER_KEY = cw.USER_ID` in `contract_writers` was corrected from `su.SYSTEM_USER_KEY = cw.USER_KEY` to `su.SYSTEM_USER_KEY = cw.USER_ID`. This indicates a correction in joining the system user with the contract writer, specifically using `USER_ID` for the contract writer.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:48:11 AM**: The `JOIN` conditions for `DIM_FEE` and `DIM_FEE_CATEGORY` within the `item_counts` CTE were changed from `fee.FEE_KEY = ci.FEE_KEY` to `fee.FEE_ID = ci.FEE_ID` and `fc.FEE_CATEGORY_KEY = fee.FEE_CATEGORY_KEY` to `fC.FEE_CATEGORY_ID = fee.FEE_CATEGORY_ID`. This is another consistency fix, changing from `_KEY` to `_ID`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 12:23:40 PM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.
    *   **1/8/2026, 12:25:13 PM**: The `getDataWithDateRange1` method was removed, and the primary `getDataWithDateRange` method was restored, now incorporating the `DIM_FACILITY` join and `Facility_ID`, `Facility_Name` selections, and using `CONTACT_ID` for associations in `base_contracts`, `primary_contacts`, and `deceased_contacts` CTEs, and `CONTRACT_ID` in `contract_writers` and `item_counts`. This effectively combines and refines the previous changes into a single, main data retrieval method. The `LIMIT 1` clause was also removed from the end of the query in this version of `getDataWithDateRange`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 12:29:38 PM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.
    *   **1/8/2026, 1:03:44 PM**: The `CREATED_BY` conditions in the `primary_contacts` and `deceased_contacts` CTEs were changed from `bc.CREATED_BY = dco.CREATED_BY` and `dco.CREATED_BY = dc.CREATED_BY` to `dco.CREATED_BY` on its own. It's unclear if this is a mistake or intended logic, as `dco.CREATED_BY` is now selected but not used in the join. The `CONTACT_KEY` fields in the `SELECT` list are now `CONTACT_ID`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 1:18:19 PM**: The changes introduced in the previous timestamp (regarding `dco.CREATED_BY` in join) were reverted, and the `CREATED_BY` conditions were corrected to `dco.CREATED_BY = dc.CREATED_BY`.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:29:14 AM**: The `getDataWithDateRange` method was heavily modified for debugging. The date range filtering was commented out, and a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '660-1004010262'` filter was re-introduced. The `EXISTS` subquery condition was also commented out. A `LIMIT 1` clause was re-added to the final `SELECT` statement. This indicates a focus on isolating and testing a specific contract.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:29:23 AM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.

*   **`\response_fd37b194-620b-4981-a320-76fc5f36551b\0` (Corresponds to `c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`)**
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:14:12 AM**: Initial content for `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`. This mapper class is responsible for transforming `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` into HubSpot-compatible contact and deal data. It initializes `HubSpotOwnerService` and `HubSpotLocationService` and fetches HubSpot owners and locations. Key mapping logic includes handling phone number priority (landline then mobile), validating dates, generating deal names, and formatting various fields (e.g., `loc_id`, `state`, `relationship_to_the_deceased`, `pipeline`, `hubspot_owner_id`, `dealstage`). It also includes a `mergePreNeedItemCountsToPrimaryContact` method conditional on `HUBSPOT_PLOTBOX_ALLOW_ITEMS_COUNT` env variable.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:15:29 AM**: The `mapDeceasedContact` method was updated to explicitly set `date_of_birth` and `date_of_death` directly from the `plotBoxDto` without prior `isValidDate` checks within the initial array construction. The `isValidDate` checks were removed from the initial array assignment.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:15:37 AM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:20:17 AM**: In `mapContact`, the `date_of_birth` assignment was updated to use `primaryDateOfBirth` from `plotBoxDto` and to apply `isValidDate` check before conversion. In `mapDeceasedContact`, the explicit assignments for `date_of_birth` and `date_of_death` from `plotBoxDto` were removed from the initial array. Instead, a `foreach` loop was added to iterate over `datesArray = ['date_of_birth', 'date_of_death']` and apply `isValidDate` and conversion for each, using `data[$date]` as the source for the value *before* the `trim($plotBoxDto->{$date})` call, which appears to be a logical error or a work-in-progress.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:24:38 AM**: In `mapDeceasedContact`, the `foreach` loop for dates was corrected to use `$plotBoxDto->{$date}` as the source for the `isValidDate` check, and then `trim($plotBoxDto->{$date})` for the conversion, fixing the potential logical error from the previous commit.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:25:29 AM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:31:54 AM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:32:58 AM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:43:23 AM**: The `isValidDate` method was updated. The condition `($timestamp <= 0)` was removed, meaning `strtotime` returning 0 (e.g., for '1970-01-01') is now considered valid, and `in_array($date, [...])` checks for specific zero-like date strings were added/modified to explicitly invalidate them. Also, the `formatMappedFields` method was updated to include `str_replace(' ', '', trim($value))` for `pipeline` and `dealstage` to normalize values for better matching.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:50:35 AM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:26:48 AM**: Content for the `PlotBoxHubSpotService` class. This service coordinates the syncing of PlotBox data to HubSpot. It fetches data, maps it using `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`, and then processes batches of primary contacts, deceased contacts, and deals. It includes logic for searching existing entities in HubSpot, creating/updating them, associating primary/deceased contacts, and then associating contacts and deals to locations. Extensive error logging and `sleep` calls are used to manage API rate limits and processing times. A `dd($dealsBatch, $primaryContactBatch)` debugging statement was present after initial batch preparation.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:26:59 AM**: No functional change; the content is identical to the previous timestamp.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:53:47 AM**: The `dd($dealsBatch, $primaryContactBatch)` debugging statement was replaced with `dd($deceasedContactBatch)`, indicating a shift in debugging focus.
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:17:46 PM**: The `dd($deceasedContactBatch)` debugging statement was removed. In the `processContacts` method, the call to `updateContact` for `primaryContactsToCreateOrUpdate` and `deceasedContactsToCreateOrUpdate` was changed to pass `null` instead of `$primaryContactBatch` or `$deceasedContactBatch` for the second argument. This implies a change in how the `updateContact` method is expected to receive updated contact data, potentially relying solely on the first argument.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **HubSpot API Integration**: All `HubSpot*Service.php` files consistently utilize the `HubSpot\Factory` to create API clients with access tokens, interact with various HubSpot CRM APIs (Contacts, Deals, Owners, Associations, Objects), and use specific HubSpot API exception classes (e.g., `ContactsApiException`, `DealsApiException`).
2.  **Configuration from `services.php`**: HubSpot-related settings, such as association type IDs, pipelines, lifecycle stages, and object type IDs, are consistently loaded from the `config('services.hubspot')` file.
3.  **Error Handling and Logging**: A prominent pattern is robust error handling with `try-catch` blocks, specifically for `ApiException` classes and general `Exception`s. Detailed error messages, status codes, response bodies, and stack traces are consistently logged using `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log::error`. This indicates a strong focus on debugging and operational stability.
4.  **Data Transformation and Cleaning**: Before sending data to HubSpot, a recurring step involves removing specific internal properties (e.g., `'loc_id'`, `'last_update_dt'`, `'exists'`) to prevent sending irrelevant or conflicting data. This is evident in `HubSpotContactService::createContact`/`updateContact` and `HubSpotDealService::createDeal`/`updateDeal`.
5.  **Constructor Injection and Initialization**: HubSpot services are typically initialized in their constructors with an `apiToken` and `source` string. The `HubSpotServiceProvider` demonstrates how these services are instantiated with appropriate tokens and dependencies.
6.  **Date Handling**: The `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` includes a `isValidDate` utility and uses `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` and `convert_utc_date_to_epoch` for consistent date formatting before sending to HubSpot, addressing potential issues with invalid or zero dates.
7.  **Debugging Practices**: There's a notable pattern of adding and removing `dd()` (die and dump) statements in `HubSpotServiceProvider`, `HubSpotContactService`, and `PlotBoxHubSpotService`, as well as modifying `LIMIT` clauses in SQL queries within `PlotBox\Contact.php`, suggesting active development and debugging sessions.
8.  **Data Normalization in Mappers**: The `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` standardizes data fields like `state` (uppercasing), `relationship_to_the_deceased` (to a constant), and `pipeline`/`dealstage` (normalizing to 'at-need' or 'pre-need' values from configuration).
9.  **Data Source (Snowflake)**: The `PlotBox\Contact.php` model consistently interacts with a Snowflake database (`DB::connection('snowflake')`) to fetch complex, aggregated data for CRM synchronization.
10. **ID/Key Consistency**: There were several changes in `PlotBox\Contact.php` related to ensuring consistent usage of `_KEY` vs `_ID` fields across various tables in SQL joins and select statements, suggesting a refactoring effort to standardize data identifiers.

## 1:21:11 PM
The code changes primarily focus on integrating PlotBox data with HubSpot CRM, involving updates to HubSpot service classes, a data mapping component, and a data retrieval model. Key information from these changes is as follows:

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotContactService.php`**
    *   **January 2, 2026, 11:41:48 AM**: The initial version established methods for creating, updating, and associating contacts in HubSpot. It included logic to remove internal properties (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `service_type_code`) before sending data to HubSpot and incorporated error logging for API and general exceptions.
    *   **January 2, 2026, 12:01:48 PM - 12:03:11 PM**: A debugging `dd($apiToken);` statement was temporarily added to and then removed from the constructor.
    *   **January 2, 2026, 12:16:54 PM**: The constructor signature was updated to be more explicit about type hints (`?string $apiToken, string $source`).
    *   **January 9, 2026, 12:44:20 PM**: A `var_dump($contactProperties);` debugging statement was added inside the `updateContact` method.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotDealService.php`**
    *   **January 2, 2026, 11:41:59 AM**: Introduced methods for creating, updating, and associating deals in HubSpot, including property removal and error handling similar to the Contact Service.
    *   **January 2, 2026, 12:17:50 PM**: The constructor signature was updated with more explicit type hints (`?string $apiToken, string $source`).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotLocationService.php`**
    *   **January 2, 2026, 11:42:16 AM**: Implemented functionalities for managing HubSpot custom 'Location' objects, such as retrieving IDs by code, getting association type IDs, and associating contacts/deals with locations. It also uses caching for locations.
    *   **January 2, 2026, 12:17:39 PM**: The constructor signature was updated with more explicit type hints (`?string $apiToken, string $source`).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotOwnerService.php`**
    *   **January 2, 2026, 11:43:42 AM**: Provided methods to fetch lists of HubSpot owners and retrieve owner details by email.
    *   **January 2, 2026, 12:17:13 PM**: The constructor signature was updated with more explicit type hints (`?string $apiToken, string $source`).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Providers\HubSpotServiceProvider.php`**
    *   **January 2, 2026, 11:47:45 AM**: Configured the binding of `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` to the application container, injecting the respective HubSpot CRM services with API tokens. A `dd($hmisToken);` debugging statement was present.
    *   **January 2, 2026, 12:00:29 PM**: The `dd($hmisToken);` debugging statement was removed.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **January 6, 2026, 3:15:57 PM**: Introduced a complex SQL query in `getDataWithDateRange` to retrieve detailed contact, contract, and item information from a Snowflake data warehouse, including primary and deceased contacts and sales items.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 10:29:41 AM - January 9, 2026, 11:29:23 AM**: This file underwent significant, iterative changes to its SQL query logic, often involving:
        *   Adding and removing `LIMIT 1` clauses, likely for testing single records.
        *   Renaming `getDataWithDateRange` to `getDataWithDateRange1` or `getDataWithDateRange2` while creating new `getDataWithDateRange` implementations, suggesting an iterative refactoring process or concurrent testing.
        *   Commenting out or hardcoding specific contract numbers (`'660-1004010262'`) in `WHERE` clauses of the SQL query, indicating focused debugging on particular records.
        *   Adjusting join conditions and column references in the Snowflake SQL, such as `CREATED_BY_KEY` to `CREATED_BY`, `FACILITY_KEY` to `FACILITY_ID`, `FEE_KEY` to `FEE_ID`, and `USER_KEY` to `USER_ID`. This suggests schema adjustments or correction of data model inconsistencies.
        *   Temporary removal and re-addition of the `DIM_FACILITY` join for retrieving `Location_Cd`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:14:12 AM**: This mapper class was introduced to transform `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` into HubSpot CRM contact and deal properties. It included logic for:
        *   Prioritizing phone numbers (landline over mobile).
        *   Mapping primary and deceased contact details, including lifecycle stages.
        *   Generating deal names and mapping financial and contractual data.
        *   Helper functions for date validation (`isValidDate`), owner lookup (`findOwnerIdByEmail`), and location ID lookup (`getLocationIdByCode`).
        *   Conditional merging of pre-need item counts.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:15:29 AM - 11:25:29 AM**: Repeated small changes and reversions related to date handling in `mapContact` and `mapDeceasedContact`, particularly around the `isValidDate` check before converting date strings to milliseconds. The changes show an attempt to streamline date conversion and validation.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:43:23 AM**: Improved the `formatMappedFields` method by adding normalization (lowercase, remove spaces) to `pipeline` and `dealstage` values for more robust matching. The `isValidDate` helper also had its `strtotime` validation adjusted to be less restrictive for old dates.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:26:48 AM**: This service was implemented to manage the end-to-end synchronization of PlotBox data to HubSpot. It orchestrates data retrieval, mapping, and the creation/updating of contacts, deals, and associations. It included `sleep` calls to handle HubSpot API rate limits. Debugging `dd()` statements were present in `syncPlotBoxData`.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:53:47 AM - 12:17:46 PM**: The `dd()` debugging statements in `syncPlotBoxData` were temporarily removed and then re-added, indicating active testing of the sync process.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\helpers.php`**
    *   **January 9, 2026, 12:26:40 PM**: This file contains a collection of utility functions. The `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` and `convert_utc_date_to_epoch` functions are particularly relevant for HubSpot integration, as HubSpot expects epoch milliseconds for date properties.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 12:26:57 PM - 1:10:08 PM**: Frequent, granular changes were applied to the `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` function. These iterations focused on:
        *   Ensuring dates are correctly set to midnight UTC.
        *   Explicitly setting the original timezone to 'America/New_York'.
        *   Handling edge cases for null, empty, or '0' date strings.
        *   Adding a check (`if ($timestamp < 0) return $dateString;`) to prevent negative timestamps (possibly from invalid old dates) from being converted.
        *   Adding `substr` and `preg_match` for stricter `YYYY-MM-DD` date format validation.
    *   The `convert_utc_date_to_epoch` function also saw a brief change and reversion related to multiplying by 1000, confirming the intent to return epoch milliseconds.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HubSpot API Integration:** A consistent theme across `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`, and `HubSpotOwnerService` is the interaction with the HubSpot CRM API using the `HubSpot\Factory::createWithAccessToken()` and subsequent calls to various API clients (e.g., `crm()->contacts()->basicApi()->create()`).
*   **Robust Error Handling & Logging:** All HubSpot service methods and the data sync service (`PlotBoxHubSpotService`) extensively use `try-catch` blocks and `Log::error` to capture and report exceptions and API errors, often including HTTP status codes, response bodies, and stack traces for detailed debugging. This indicates a focus on resilient and observable data synchronization.
*   **Configuration-Driven Values:** HubSpot-specific IDs and values (like association type IDs, lifecycle stages, pipeline IDs, object type IDs) are consistently fetched from `config('services.hubspot...')`, promoting flexibility and environment-specific settings.
*   **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Both `HubSpotContactService`/`HubSpotDealService` (removing internal properties like `loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`) and `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` (trimming, uppercasing, looking up IDs, date conversions, pipeline normalization) perform significant data manipulation to prepare information for HubSpot.
*   **Iterative Debugging and Refinement:** The frequent additions/removals of `dd()` and `var_dump()` statements, coupled with numerous small, specific changes and reversions in the SQL query (`PlotBox\Contact.php`) and date helper functions (`helpers.php`), clearly indicate an active development and debugging cycle, particularly around data retrieval, mapping, and date consistency.
*   **Date Handling Complexity:** The repeated modifications to date conversion helper functions highlight the challenges and attention to detail required for handling date formats, timezones, and epoch conversions correctly for external API integrations like HubSpot.

## 2:20:59 PM
The log indicates a series of changes focused on integrating PlotBox data with HubSpot CRM, primarily concerning contacts, deals, and locations. A significant number of changes occurred on January 2nd, 2026, and January 8th-9th, 2026.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotContactService.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:41:48 AM:** The initial state of this file shows methods for creating, updating, and associating contacts in HubSpot. It includes error logging for API exceptions and general exceptions, and handles specific properties to remove before sending data to HubSpot. It also sets up association type IDs for next-of-kin contacts and contact-to-deal associations from configuration.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:01:48 PM:** A `dd($apiToken);` statement was temporarily added to the constructor, likely for debugging purposes.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:03:11 PM:** The debugging `dd($apiToken);` statement was removed from the constructor.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:16:54 PM:** The constructor's `apiToken` parameter type hint was changed from `string` to `?string`, allowing it to accept `null`.
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:44:20 PM:** A `var_dump($contactProperties);` debugging statement was added within the `updateContact` method.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotDealService.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:41:59 AM:** This file contains methods for creating, updating, and associating deals with contacts in HubSpot. It also handles property removal and robust error logging. It fetches deal-to-contact association type ID and search configuration from application settings.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:17:50 PM:** The constructor's `apiToken` parameter type hint was changed from `string` to `?string`, allowing it to accept `null`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotLocationService.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:42:16 AM:** This service manages HubSpot locations, including fetching location IDs by code, retrieving association type IDs, and associating contacts or deals with locations. It utilizes a cache for association types and includes detailed error logging for API calls.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:17:39 PM:** The constructor's `apiToken` parameter type hint was changed from `string` to `?string`, allowing it to accept `null`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotOwnerService.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:43:42 AM:** This service is responsible for retrieving HubSpot owner lists and searching for owners by email, including error handling.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:17:13 PM:** The constructor's `apiToken` parameter type hint was changed from `string` to `?string`, allowing it to accept `null`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Providers\HubSpotServiceProvider.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:47:45 AM:** This service provider registers `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` as singletons, injecting `HubSpotContactService` and `HubSpotDealService` with their respective API tokens. A `dd($hmisToken);` statement was temporarily added to the `HmisHubSpotService` binding.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:00:29 PM:** The debugging `dd($hmisToken);` statement was removed from the `HmisHubSpotService` binding.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\config\services.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:08:26 PM:** This configuration file defines various HubSpot service parameters, including API URL, different association type IDs, lifecycle stages, pipeline IDs, object type IDs for associations, and detailed search and property configurations for 'hmis' and 'plotbox' data sources. This is a comprehensive configuration update.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **1/6/2026, 3:15:57 PM:** This file defines an Eloquent model for PlotBox contacts, connecting to a Snowflake database. It includes relationships and a complex SQL query (`getDataWithDateRange`) to fetch contract and contact data, along with various item counts (caskets, cremation products, etc.). A `getHubspotData` method is introduced as a wrapper for `getDataWithDateRange` for the current date.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:29:41 AM - 1/8/2026, 10:35:05 AM:** Several minor changes appear in the SQL query within `getDataWithDateRange`. Specifically, a `LIMIT 1` clause was repeatedly added to the main `SELECT` statement at the end of the query. The `getDataWithDateRange1` function was also introduced, with some commented out or specific conditions (`DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '660-1004010262'`) in some versions.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:40:26 AM:** The `getDataWithDateRange1` function's `LIMIT 1` was removed. The `LEFT JOIN DIM_FACILITY df ON pc.FACILITY_KEY = df.FACILITY_KEY` clause was added to the main SELECT statement.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:45:21 AM:** The original `getDataWithDateRange` was modified to include a specific `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter (`'660-1004010262'`) and commented out the date range and EXISTS clause in the `base_contracts` CTE, effectively hardcoding a test case. A new `getDataWithDateRange` function was re-introduced with the original date range logic. This resulted in two methods with very similar names (`getDataWithDateRange` and `getDataWithDateRange1`) but different query logic.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:52:47 AM:** The changes from 10:45:21 AM (hardcoded contract number and commented out parts) seem to have been reverted in the main `getDataWithDateRange` method, while `getDataWithDateRange1` retained the `LIMIT 1` clause. The `DIM_FACILITY` join was also present.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:55:03 AM - 1/8/2026, 11:04:46 AM:** The changes seem to be primarily minor reverts or re-applications of `LIMIT 1` and slight structural modifications within the SQL query, particularly affecting the `DIM_FACILITY` join. The `getDataWithDateRange1` method consistently includes `LIMIT 1`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:04:55 AM:** In `getDataWithDateRange`, the `Location_Cd` column's calculation was changed from `df.FACILITY_SHORT_NAME` to `SUBSTRING(CAST(pc.CONTACT_KEY AS STRING), 1, 3)`, meaning the location code is now derived from the `CONTACT_KEY` rather than the facility table. The `LEFT JOIN DIM_FACILITY df` was removed from the main SELECT.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:06:38 AM - 1/8/2026, 11:10:53 AM:** The SQL queries in `getDataWithDateRange` (and `getDataWithDateRange1`, which seems to be a redundant copy) were repeatedly modified, specifically around how `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER` and `DIM_CONTACT` are joined (`CREATED_BY_KEY` vs `CREATED_BY`) and how `DIM_FACILITY` is joined (`FACILITY_KEY` vs `FACILITY_ID`).
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:18:21 AM - 1/8/2026, 12:29:38 PM:** Continued adjustments to the SQL query logic, particularly focusing on join conditions for `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER`, `DIM_CONTACT`, `DIM_CONTRACT_ITEM`, `DIM_FEE`, and `DIM_FEE_CATEGORY`. There's a shift from joining on `_KEY` fields to `_ID` fields for `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER` and `DIM_CONTACT`. Also, in `item_counts`, the join for `DIM_FEE` changed from `FEE_KEY` to `FEE_ID`, and for `DIM_FEE_CATEGORY` from `FEE_CATEGORY_KEY` to `FEE_CATEGORY_ID`. This indicates a significant change in how these tables are linked in the Snowflake schema. The `Created_By_Key` was also introduced as a selected column in the final SELECT.
    *   **1/8/2026, 1:03:44 PM:** In `getDataWithDateRange`, the `CREATED_BY` alias was added to the `primary_contacts` and `deceased_contacts` CTEs, and used in their join conditions, further refining the join logic based on `CREATED_BY`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 1:18:19 PM:** The `getDataWithDateRange1` function was removed, consolidating the data fetching logic into a single `getDataWithDateRange` method. This also indicates the end of the temporary debugging or experimental method.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:14:12 AM:** This new file introduces `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` responsible for mapping PlotBox data to HubSpot CRM format. It handles contact, deceased contact, and deal mapping, including logic for phone number priority, date validation (`isValidDate`), generating deal names, and formatting fields (e.g., location lookup, state uppercasing, pipeline/dealstage standardization, owner ID lookup). It also includes a destructor for resource cleanup and a `mergePreNeedItemCountsToPrimaryContact` method.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:15:29 AM - 1/9/2026, 11:15:37 AM:** Minor cleanups, likely formatting or white-space related, as the code content is essentially identical.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:20:17 AM:** Added `primaryDateOfBirth` as a valid date check for `date_of_birth` and `birthday` fields in the `mapContact` method.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:24:38 AM:** Removed the explicit `date_of_birth` and `date_of_death` assignments from the `mapDeceasedContact` method and replaced them with a loop over `$datesArray` to apply `isValidDate` and `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` to these fields.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:25:29 AM - 1/9/2026, 11:32:58 AM:** Minor changes, primarily revert and re-application of changes, and likely debugging `var_dump('here');` and `var_dump('there');` statements were added to `mapDeceasedContact` for date validation.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:43:23 AM:** Enhanced the `formatMappedFields` method to normalize `pipeline` and `dealstage` values by removing spaces and converting to lowercase before checking for "at-need" or "pre-need" terms. Also added `birthday` field mapping for primary contacts.
    *   **1/9/2026, 1:41:42 PM:** Added `birthday` field mapping for deceased contacts, mirroring the change made for primary contacts.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:26:48 AM:** This file details the core synchronization logic for PlotBox data to HubSpot. It orchestrates the mapping, searching, creating, updating, and associating of contacts, deceased contacts, and deals. It includes comprehensive error handling and logging. A `dd($dealsBatch, $primaryContactBatch);` statement was temporarily added in the `syncPlotBoxData` method.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:26:59 AM:** The previous `dd` statement in `syncPlotBoxData` was updated to `dd($dealsBatch, $primaryContactBatch, $deceasedContactBatch);` to include deceased contact batch for debugging.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:53:47 AM:** The `dd($deceasedContactBatch);` debugging statement was removed from `syncPlotBoxData`.
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:17:46 PM - 1/9/2026, 12:31:34 PM:** A `dd($deceasedContactBatch);` (or similar `dd` statements) reappears in `syncPlotBoxData` and is then removed.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\helpers.php`**
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:26:40 PM:** This file defines several helper functions. The `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` function converts a date string from 'America/New_York' timezone to UTC milliseconds, setting the time to midnight. `convert_utc_date_to_epoch` converts a UTC date string to epoch milliseconds.
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:26:57 PM:** Minor formatting or whitespace change in `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` (removal of `setTime(0,0,0)`).
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:29:20 PM:** The `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` function was reverted to its previous state (including `setTime(0,0,0)`), but the multiplication by `1000` for milliseconds was removed from its return.
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:30:41 PM:** The `convert_utc_date_to_epoch` function had its multiplication by `1000` for milliseconds removed. This would cause both date conversion helpers to return timestamps in seconds instead of milliseconds.
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:32:57 PM:** `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` had `* 1000` re-added to its return, but `convert_utc_date_to_epoch` remained in seconds.
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:51:15 PM:** `convert_utc_date_to_epoch` had `* 1000` re-added.
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:52:33 PM:** The `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` function was modified to concatenate `' 00:00:00'` to the input `$dateString` before creating the `DateTime` object. This explicitly ensures midnight is used if the input date string lacks time information.
    *   **1/9/2026, 1:03:46 PM - 1/9/2026, 1:10:08 PM:** The `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` function was further refined by adding an early return for `$dateString` if the `timestamp` is invalid (`< 0`) and introducing `substr` and `preg_match` to enforce a 'YYYY-MM-DD' format and handle invalid date strings gracefully. Multiple minor changes within this timeframe indicate active debugging and refinement of date handling logic.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **HubSpot Integration:** A core theme is the synchronization of data from various sources (PlotBox, HMIS implied in comments) into HubSpot CRM. This involves contacts, deals, and custom objects (locations).
2.  **API Token-based Authentication:** Services like `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`, and `HubSpotOwnerService` are instantiated with an `$apiToken`, emphasizing a secure access model to HubSpot.
3.  **Error Handling and Logging:** Robust error handling using `try-catch` blocks is prevalent across all HubSpot-related services. Specific HubSpot API exceptions (`ContactsApiException`, `DealsApiException`, `AssociationsApiException`, `ObjectsApiException`, `OwnersApiException`) are caught and logged with detailed error messages and response bodies, indicating a focus on debugging and operational stability. General `Exception` catches are also used.
4.  **Data Mapping and Transformation:** The `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` class highlights the need to transform raw source data (`PlotBoxDataTransferObject`) into a format suitable for HubSpot. This includes trimming strings, type conversions, and looking up IDs from HubSpot (e.g., owner IDs, location IDs).
5.  **Configuration-driven Behavior:** Many parameters (e.g., association type IDs, lifecycle stages, pipeline IDs, deal search configurations) are retrieved from `config('services.hubspot...')`, indicating a flexible and configurable system.
6.  **Date Handling Refinement:** Multiple changes in `app\helpers.php` show continuous refinement of date conversion functions (`date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis`, `convert_utc_date_to_epoch`). This includes addressing null/empty inputs, ensuring UTC conversion, handling timezone conversions, setting specific times (midnight), and validating date string formats. There was a temporary period where `* 1000` for milliseconds was removed and re-added.
7.  **SQL Query Evolution (PlotBox Contact Model):** The `getDataWithDateRange` method in `app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` underwent significant and iterative development. This involved:
    *   Refining the WHERE clause logic for `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` and `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME`.
    *   Adding and removing `LIMIT 1` clauses, suggesting testing and debugging specific contract data.
    *   Introducing a new `getDataWithDateRange1` method that seems to be a temporary copy for different SQL logic, which was later removed.
    *   Frequent changes to `JOIN` conditions, particularly switching between `_KEY` and `_ID` suffixes for various tables (`DIM_CONTRACT`, `DIM_CONTACT_OWNER`, `DIM_CONTACT`, `DIM_FEE`, `DIM_FEE_CATEGORY`, `DIM_FACILITY`), indicating schema adaptation or correction.
    *   Changing how `Location_Cd` is derived (from `FACILITY_SHORT_NAME` to a substring of `CONTACT_KEY`).
8.  **Debugging Practices:** The presence of `dd()` and `var_dump()` statements in multiple files and their subsequent removal indicates active development and debugging throughout the changes. `usleep(100000);` calls are also used to introduce delays, likely to prevent rate limiting during API calls, another common debugging/mitigation strategy.
9.  **Idempotency and Resilience:** The HubSpot service methods (e.g., `createContact`, `updateContact`) are designed to continue processing other items in a batch even if one fails, logging specific errors for failed items rather than halting the entire operation.
10. **Data Source Specifics:** The configuration and mapper reveal specific properties and logic tailored for 'hmis' and 'plotbox' data, suggesting a multi-source integration architecture.

## 4:21:04 PM
The provided log entries show a series of changes focused on integrating PlotBox data with HubSpot CRM, primarily concerning contacts, deals, and locations. Key updates include:

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotContactService.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:41:48 AM**: Initial commit or major update of the `HubSpotContactService`. This file handles the creation, updating, and association of contacts in HubSpot, including associating primary and deceased contacts. It defines methods like `createContact`, `updateContact`, and `associatePrimaryAndDeceasedContacts`, and logs extensively at each step. It explicitly removes 'loc_id', 'last_update_dt', and 'exists' properties, and conditionally 'service_type_code' before sending data to HubSpot.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:01:48 PM**: A `dd($apiToken);` (dump and die) statement was temporarily added to the constructor for debugging purposes.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:03:11 PM**: The debugging `dd($apiToken);` statement was removed from the constructor, reverting it to the previous state.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:16:54 PM**: The constructor signature was updated to allow the `$apiToken` parameter to be nullable (`?string $apiToken`).
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:44:20 PM**: A `var_dump($contactProperties);` statement was temporarily added within the `updateContact` method for debugging.
    *   **1/9/2026, 3:21:01 PM**: The `var_dump($contactProperties);` statement was removed from `updateContact`. No other functional changes were introduced.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotDealService.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:41:59 AM**: Initial commit or major update of the `HubSpotDealService`. This service handles creating, updating, and associating deals with contacts in HubSpot. It defines `createDeal`, `updateDeal`, and `associateDealWithContact` methods. Similar to `HubSpotContactService`, it explicitly removes 'loc_id', 'last_update_dt', 'exists', and 'hmis_account_number' properties before sending data to HubSpot.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:17:50 PM**: The constructor signature was updated to allow the `$apiToken` parameter to be nullable (`?string $apiToken`).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotLocationService.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:42:16 AM**: Initial commit or major update of the `HubSpotLocationService`. This service manages HubSpot custom objects for locations and their associations with contacts and deals. It includes methods for fetching location IDs by code, retrieving association type IDs, and associating contacts/deals to locations, including a `batchAssociateWithLocation` method. It also incorporates caching mechanisms for locations. Debugging `echo` statements are present in `getLocationIdByCode` and `associateContactToLocation`.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:17:39 PM**: The constructor signature was updated to allow the `$apiToken` parameter to be nullable (`?string $apiToken`).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotOwnerService.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:43:42 AM**: Initial commit or major update of the `HubSpotOwnerService`. This service is responsible for retrieving HubSpot owner information, including fetching a list of all owners and searching for an owner by email address.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:17:13 PM**: The constructor signature was updated to allow the `$apiToken` parameter to be nullable (`?string $apiToken`).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Providers\HubSpotServiceProvider.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 11:47:45 AM**: This service provider binds `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` to the application container, configuring them with `HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `EloquentHubSpotRepository`, and API tokens from the application configuration. A `dd($hmisToken);` statement was temporarily added to the `HmisHubSpotService` binding.
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:00:29 PM**: The debugging `dd($hmisToken);` statement was removed from the `HmisHubSpotService` binding.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\config\services.php`**
    *   **1/2/2026, 12:08:26 PM**: This configuration file defines various HubSpot-related settings, including API URL, multiple association type IDs (contact-to-contact, contact-to-deal, next-of-kin, contact-to-location, deal-to-contact, deal-to-location), lifecycle stages, pipelines, custom object type IDs, deal search configurations for 'hmis' and 'plotbox', and source-specific API tokens and properties.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **1/6/2026, 3:15:57 PM**: This file defines an Eloquent model for PlotBox contacts and includes a complex SQL query (`getDataWithDateRange`) to retrieve contact and contract-related data from Snowflake, along with an initial logging of the first query result. The `getHubspotData` method is a wrapper for `getDataWithDateRange` for the current date.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:29:41 AM**: The `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query was modified by adding `LIMIT 1` at the end, suggesting a change for debugging or limiting results.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:31:58 AM**: The `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query was further modified to include `df.FACILITY_ID AS Facility_ID, df.FACILITY_NAME AS Facility_Name` in the `SELECT` clause and added a `LEFT JOIN WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_FACILITY df ON pc.FACILITY_KEY = df.FACILITY_KEY` to retrieve facility details. The `LIMIT 1` remains.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:33:02 AM**: No functional changes, identical to the previous commit.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:40:26 AM**: The `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query was modified by removing the `LEFT JOIN WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_FACILITY df ON pc.FACILITY_KEY = df.FACILITY_KEY` and changing `Location_Cd` to `SUBSTRING(CAST(pc.CONTACT_KEY AS STRING), 1, 3)`. The `LIMIT 1` remains.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:45:21 AM**: A new method `getDataWithDateRange1` was introduced, which is identical to the previous `getDataWithDateRange` at `10:40:26 AM` but with a `LIMIT 1` clause. The original `getDataWithDateRange` was modified to include a hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '660-1004010262'` condition and commented out date range and `EXISTS` clause. This looks like a significant debugging step, possibly isolating a specific contract for testing.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:52:47 AM**: The commented-out date range and `EXISTS` conditions in `getDataWithDateRange` were uncommented, but the `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '660-1004010262'` remains, effectively adding multiple filtering conditions (likely for testing purposes). The `LIMIT 1` remains.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:55:03 AM**: The `getDataWithDateRange` method's SQL query had an extra 'W' in `WWITH base_contracts` at the beginning, introducing a syntax error.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:55:38 AM**: The extra 'W' in `WWITH base_contracts` was removed, correcting the syntax error in `getDataWithDateRange`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 10:56:12 AM**: No functional changes, identical to the previous commit.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:00:21 AM**: The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER` condition and the commented-out `EXISTS` clause were removed from `getDataWithDateRange`, reverting it to the original date range filtering logic, but `LIMIT 1` remains. `getDataWithDateRange1` still exists.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:04:46 AM**: No functional changes, identical to the previous commit.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:04:55 AM**: The `getDataWithDateRange` method was reverted to its previous state before adding `df.FACILITY_SHORT_NAME` and `DIM_FACILITY` join. It now uses `SUBSTRING(CAST(pc.CONTACT_KEY AS STRING), 1, 3) AS Location_Cd` and does not join `DIM_FACILITY`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:05:24 AM**: The `getDataWithDateRange` method was restored to include the `DIM_FACILITY` join and `df.FACILITY_SHORT_NAME AS Location_Cd`. The `LIMIT 1` remains.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:06:38 AM**: No functional changes, but `getDataWithDateRange1` renamed to `getDataWithDateRange2`. This is likely a mistake or temporary.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:09:22 AM**: The `CREATED_BY_KEY` column in `base_contracts` and join conditions `dco.CREATED_BY_KEY = bc.CREATED_BY_KEY`, `dco.CREATED_BY_KEY = dc.CREATED_BY_KEY` were changed to `CREATED_BY`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:10:18 AM**: The `getDataWithDateRange` method was reverted to its previous state before `df.FACILITY_SHORT_NAME` was added, and it uses `SUBSTRING(CAST(pc.CONTACT_KEY AS STRING), 1, 3)`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:10:53 AM**: `getDataWithDateRange` method was restored to include the `DIM_FACILITY` join.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:11:00 AM**: No functional changes, identical to previous commit.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:18:21 AM**: The `DIM_CONTRACT.CREATED_BY_KEY` was changed to `DIM_CONTRACT.CREATED_BY`, and `DIM_CONTRACT.FACILITY_KEY` was changed to `DIM_CONTRACT.FACILITY_ID`. The join condition for `DIM_FACILITY` was changed from `pc.FACILITY_KEY` to `pc.FACILITY_ID`. The `getDataWithDateRange1` method still uses `CREATED_BY` for joins.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:19:46 AM**: The join condition `dco.CONTACT_KEY = dc.CONTACT_KEY` was changed to `dco.CONTACT_ID = dc.CONTACT_KEY` in `base_contracts` EXISTS clause, `primary_contacts`, and `deceased_contacts` CTEs for both `getDataWithDateRange1` and `getDataWithDateRange`. `contract_writers` CTE now uses `cw.CONTRACT_ID` and `cw.USER_ID` in its join and where clauses. This represents a significant change in how contacts and contracts are linked. `DIM_CONTRACT_ITEM` now uses `ci.FEE_ID` and `fc.FEE_CATEGORY_ID` for joins.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:41:47 AM**: The join conditions `dco.CONTACT_KEY = dc.CONTACT_KEY` in `base_contracts` EXISTS clause, `primary_contacts`, and `deceased_contacts` CTEs were changed back to `dco.CONTACT_ID = dc.CONTACT_KEY` for `getDataWithDateRange1`. Also, `dco.CONTRACT_KEY = DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_KEY` was changed to `dco.CONTRACT_ID = DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_KEY`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:42:34 AM**: The join conditions within `primary_contacts` and `deceased_contacts` CTEs related to `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER` and `DIM_CONTACT` were adjusted. Specifically, `dco.CONTACT_ID = dc.CONTACT_KEY` and `dco.CONTRACT_ID = DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_KEY`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:44:53 AM**: No functional changes, identical to previous commit.
    *   **1/8/2026, 11:48:11 AM**: The `contract_writers` CTE join for `DIM_SYSTEM_USER` changed from `su.SYSTEM_USER_KEY = cw.USER_ID` to `su.SYSTEM_USER_KEY = cw.USER_KEY`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 12:23:40 PM**: Item counts (e.g., `caskets_owned`) were changed from `COALESCE(ci.QUANTITY, 1)` to `COALESCE(ci.QUANTITY, 0)` in `item_counts` CTE. Also, the `DIM_FEE` join in `item_counts` was changed from `fee.FEE_KEY = ci.FEE_KEY` to `fee.FEE_ID = ci.FEE_ID`, and `DIM_FEE_CATEGORY` changed from `fc.FEE_CATEGORY_KEY = fee.FEE_CATEGORY_KEY` to `fC.FEE_CATEGORY_ID = fee.FEE_CATEGORY_ID`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 12:25:13 PM**: No functional changes, identical to the previous commit.
    *   **1/8/2026, 12:29:38 PM**: The `primary_contacts` and `deceased_contacts` CTEs in `getDataWithDateRange` had their `CREATED_BY` join conditions removed (`dco.CREATED_BY = dc.CREATED_BY`). The `ORDER BY` clause in the final SELECT changed from `ORDER BY pc.CONTACT_KEY` to `ORDER BY pc.CONTACT_ID`.
    *   **1/8/2026, 12:30:57 PM**: The `CREATED_BY` column was added back to `primary_contacts` and `deceased_contacts` CTEs in `getDataWithDateRange`, and the join conditions for `CREATED_BY` were also re-introduced. The `ORDER BY` clause was reverted to `ORDER BY pc.CONTRACT_ID`. The `getDataWithDateRange1` method was removed, and the primary `getDataWithDateRange` now includes `df.FACILITY_ID AS Facility_ID, df.FACILITY_NAME AS Facility_Name` in the select and `LEFT JOIN WAREHOUSE_EVERSTORYPARTNERS.DIM_FACILITY df ON pc.FACILITY_ID = df.FACILITY_ID` in the query, with the `LIMIT 1` at the end.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:29:14 AM**: The hardcoded `DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '660-1004010262'` filter was reintroduced in the `base_contracts` CTE of `getDataWithDateRange`, and the original date range filtering and EXISTS conditions were commented out. The `LIMIT 1` clause remains.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:29:23 AM**: No functional changes, identical to the previous commit.
    *   **1/9/2026, 3:21:23 PM**: The hardcoded contract number filter in `getDataWithDateRange` was removed, and the original date range filtering and EXISTS conditions were restored. The `LIMIT 1` also seems to have been removed from the final SELECT statement, implying it will now return all results for the date range.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:14:12 AM**: Initial commit or major update of `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`. This mapper translates `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` into HubSpot-compatible contact and deal arrays. It initializes HubSpot services (Owner and Location) and retrieves configurations for lifecycle stages, pipelines, and deal stages. It defines methods like `mapContact`, `mapDeceasedContact`, `mapDeal`, `generateDealName`, `formatMappedFields` (which handles lookups for `loc_id`, `state`, `pipeline`, `hubspot_owner_id`, `dealstage`), and a `mergePreNeedItemCountsToPrimaryContact` for conditional data merging. Includes a destructor for cleanup. The `mapContact` method has logic to prioritize `phone2` (landline) over `phone1` (mobile) for the 'phone' property. It also includes an `isValidDate` helper.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:15:29 AM**: The `mapContact` method was modified to assign `phone2` to 'phone' and `phone1` to 'mobilephone' directly, rather than prioritizing. Date of birth for primary contact was removed.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:15:37 AM**: No functional changes, identical to the previous commit.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:20:17 AM**: Date of birth for the primary contact was re-added to the `mapContact` method.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:24:38 AM**: The date processing logic in `mapDeceasedContact` was refactored. Instead of individual `if ($this->isValidDate(...))` checks, it now uses a `foreach` loop over a `$datesArray`.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:25:29 AM**: No functional changes, identical to the previous commit.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:31:54 AM**: No functional changes, identical to the previous commit.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:32:58 AM**: The refactoring of date processing in `mapDeceasedContact` was reverted. It now uses individual `if ($this->isValidDate(...))` checks for `deceasedBirthDate` and `deceasedDeathDate` directly on `plotBoxDto`, without the temporary `$data[$date]` assignments.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:43:23 AM**: The `formatMappedFields` method was enhanced to include string normalization (removing spaces and lowercasing) before checking for 'at-need' or 'pre-need' in the 'pipeline' and 'dealstage' fields, making the matching more robust. Also, a 'birthday' field was added to the `mapContact` method, mapping it to `primaryDateOfBirth`.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:41:42 AM**: No functional changes, identical to previous commit.
    *   **1/9/2026, 1:45:03 PM**: The `mapDeceasedContact` method was updated to also include a 'birthday' field, mapping it to `deceasedBirthDate` in addition to `date_of_birth`. Debugging `var_dump` statements were temporarily added within `mapDeceasedContact`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:26:48 AM**: This service orchestrates the HubSpot CRM sync for PlotBox data. It fetches data, maps it using `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`, and then processes batches of contacts, deals, and associations (primary, deceased, contact-deal, and location). It includes comprehensive error logging and temporary `echo` and `dd` statements for debugging the generated batches.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:26:59 AM**: No functional changes, identical to the previous commit.
    *   **1/9/2026, 11:53:47 AM**: A `dd($deceasedContactBatch);` statement was temporarily added to the `syncPlotBoxData` method for debugging purposes.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\helpers.php`**
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:26:40 PM**: This file defines several helper functions, including `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` (converts a date string to milliseconds at midnight UTC in New York timezone) and `convert_utc_date_to_epoch` (converts a UTC date string to milliseconds since epoch).
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:26:57 PM**: The `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` function was modified to remove the `$dt->setTime(0, 0, 0);` line, meaning it would convert the date string to midnight in UTC *if* no time was specified, otherwise it would use the provided time in New York.
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:29:20 PM**: The `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` function was reverted to explicitly set the time to 00:00:00 UTC, and it now returns seconds since epoch, not milliseconds (removed `* 1000`).
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:30:41 PM**: The `convert_utc_date_to_epoch` function was modified to return seconds since epoch instead of milliseconds (removed `* 1000`).
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:32:57 PM**: The `convert_utc_date_to_epoch` function was reverted to return milliseconds since epoch (re-added `* 1000`).
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:51:15 PM**: The `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` function was reverted to return milliseconds since epoch (re-added `* 1000`).
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:52:33 PM**: The `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` function was updated to append `' 00:00:00'` to the date string when creating the `DateTime` object, ensuring it consistently represents midnight.
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:54:35 PM**: The `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` function had `$dt->setTime(0,0,0);` added before returning, explicitly setting the time to midnight.
    *   **1/9/2026, 12:58:10 PM**: No functional changes, identical to the previous commit.
    *   **1/9/2026, 1:03:46 PM**: A conditional return was added to `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis`: if the `timestamp` is less than 0 (invalid), it returns the original `$dateString`, otherwise returns milliseconds. There was a syntax error (`$dt->getTimestamp() * 1000 if`).
    *   **1/9/2026, 1:04:51 PM**: The syntax error in `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` was corrected, and the conditional return logic was adjusted for better readability.
    *   **1/9/2026, 1:04:57 PM**: No functional changes, identical to the previous commit.
    *   **1/9/2026, 1:05:08 PM**: No functional changes, identical to the previous commit.
    *   **1/9/2026, 1:09:16 PM**: The `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` function was further refined to extract only the date portion (first 10 characters) and include a `preg_match` validation for `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
    *   **1/9/2026, 1:09:50 PM**: No functional changes, identical to the previous commit.
    *   **1/9/2026, 1:10:08 PM**: No functional changes, identical to the previous commit.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **HubSpot API Integration:** The majority of changes revolve around HubSpot CRM integration for contacts, deals, locations, and owners. This includes using the `HubSpot\Factory` to create clients and interacting with various CRM APIs.
*   **Data Mapping and Transformation:** There's a clear pattern of mapping data from internal data transfer objects (`PlotBoxDataTransferObject`) to HubSpot-specific property formats. This often involves trimming strings, converting dates to epoch milliseconds, and looking up associated IDs (e.g., location IDs, owner IDs).
*   **Property Removal:** Before sending data to HubSpot, certain properties (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `hmis_account_number`, `service_type_code`) are consistently unset in `HubSpotContactService` and `HubSpotDealService` to prevent sending unnecessary or invalid fields.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Robust error handling with `try-catch` blocks is prevalent across the services (`HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`, `HubSpotOwnerService`, `PlotBoxHubSpotService`). Errors are logged using `Log::error` and often include details like error code, message, response body, and trace, allowing for comprehensive debugging and failure analysis.
*   **Debugging Statements:** Throughout the log, there are temporary `dd()` (dump and die) and `var_dump()` statements, particularly in `HubSpotServiceProvider`, `HubSpotContactService`, and `PlotBoxHubSpotService`, indicating active development and debugging sessions. These are usually added and then removed in subsequent commits.
*   **Date Handling:** Several changes focus on date formatting and conversion, with helper functions like `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` and `convert_utc_date_to_epoch` being refined to handle timezones, midnight conversions, and validation for valid date formats. There was a specific issue and fix related to `timestamp < 0` for invalid dates.
*   **SQL Query Iteration (`PlotBox\Contact.php`):** The `getDataWithDateRange` method in `PlotBox\Contact.php` shows repeated modifications to its complex SQL query. This includes adding/removing `LIMIT 1` for single-result testing, toggling hardcoded contract numbers for specific data isolation, and adjusting join conditions and selected columns (`FACILITY_KEY` vs `FACILITY_ID`, `CREATED_BY_KEY` vs `CREATED_BY`). This suggests iterative development and testing of the data retrieval logic.
*   **Service Instantiation and Configuration:** Services like `HubSpotOwnerService` and `HubSpotLocationService` are instantiated within the `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` and configured using Laravel's `config()` helper to fetch HubSpot-related IDs and tokens. Constructors of these services were updated to accept nullable API tokens.
*   **Association Logic:** HubSpot's association capabilities (`AssociationSpec`, `basicApi()->create`) are heavily utilized to link various CRM objects (contacts to contacts, contacts to locations, deals to contacts, deals to locations).
*   **Caching/Optimization:** The `HubSpotLocationService` explicitly mentions using a cache (`$this->associationTypeCache`) to minimize repeated API calls, and the `listAllLocations` method also checks for an already populated `$this->allLocations` array. `usleep(100000)` calls are also present, likely for rate limiting.

## 5:21:05 PM
The provided log details significant changes across several PHP files related to HubSpot CRM integration, a PlotBox data model, and general helper functions. The changes span from January 2nd to January 9th, 2026.

    *   **January 2, 2026, 11:42:16 AM**: Initial implementation or major update of the `HubSpotLocationService`. This service manages HubSpot custom location objects, including fetching location IDs by code, retrieving association type IDs, and associating contacts and deals with locations. It leverages caching for association types and includes robust error logging. It defines `BATCH_SIZE` and `ASSOCIATION_TYPES` constants.
    *   **January 2, 2026, 12:17:39 PM**: The `__construct` method's `apiToken` parameter was updated to accept a nullable string (`?string $apiToken`).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\Crm\Hubspot\HubSpotOwnerService.php`**
    *   **January 2, 2026, 11:43:42 AM**: Initial implementation or major update of the `HubSpotOwnerService`. This service provides functionality to retrieve a list of HubSpot owners and search for an owner by email address, with error logging.
    *   **January 2, 2026, 12:17:13 PM**: The `__construct` method's `apiToken` parameter was updated to accept a nullable string (`?string $apiToken`).

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Providers\HubSpotServiceProvider.php`**
    *   **January 2, 2026, 11:47:45 AM**: This service provider binds `PlotBoxHubSpotService` and `HmisHubSpotService` to the application container, injecting `HubSpotContactService` and `HubSpotDealService` with source-specific API tokens. A `dd($hmisToken);` debugging statement was present.
    *   **January 2, 2026, 12:00:29 PM**: The `dd($hmisToken);` debugging statement was removed from the binding of `HmisHubSpotService`.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\config\services.php`**
    *   **January 2, 2026, 12:08:26 PM**: This configuration file was updated to include detailed HubSpot service configurations. It defines various association type IDs, lifecycle stages, pipeline IDs, and object type IDs. It also includes `deal_search_config` for 'hmis' and 'plotbox' sources, specifying search properties and properties to fetch. Furthermore, it details `sources` for 'hmis' and 'plotbox', including API access tokens, ID properties, phone properties, and a list of properties to be retrieved for contacts.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Mappers\PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper.php`**
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:14:12 AM**: Introduction or major update of `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`. This class is responsible for mapping `PlotBoxDataTransferObject` to HubSpot CRM contact and deal data. It utilizes `HubSpotOwnerService` and `HubSpotLocationService` for data enrichment (e.g., looking up owner IDs and location IDs). Key fields are trimmed and formatted (e.g., state to uppercase, pipeline/dealstage normalization). It includes a `mergePreNeedItemCountsToPrimaryContact` method conditional on `HUBSPOT_PLOTBOX_ALLOW_ITEMS_COUNT` environment variable. A `isValidDate` helper was added for date validation.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:15:29 AM**: `date_of_birth` and `date_of_death` in `mapDeceasedContact` were directly assigned `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` without prior `isValidDate` checks, leading to potential issues with invalid dates.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:15:37 AM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:20:17 AM**: The `date_of_birth` assignment for the primary contact in `mapContact` was updated to use `primaryDateOfBirth` from `plotBoxDto` and include an `isValidDate` check.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:24:38 AM**: The date handling in `mapDeceasedContact` was refactored to iterate through an `$datesArray` (`date_of_birth`, `date_of_death`) and apply `isValidDate` and `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` conditionally, making it more robust.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:25:29 AM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:31:54 AM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:32:58 AM**: Debugging `var_dump('here');` and `var_dump('there');` statements were added in `mapDeceasedContact`.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:43:23 AM**: The `formatMappedFields` method was enhanced to include normalization (removing spaces and lowercasing) for `pipeline` and `dealstage` values before mapping them to configured HubSpot pipeline/deal stage IDs. A `birthday` field was added to the primary contact mapping if `primaryDateOfBirth` is valid.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 1:41:35 PM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 1:41:42 PM**: The `birthday` field was added to the deceased contact mapping if `deceasedBirthDate` is valid.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 1:45:03 PM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 3:20:18 PM**: The `var_dump` statements from `mapDeceasedContact` were removed.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\SMCore\Services\PlotBox\PlotBoxHubSpotService.php`**
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:26:48 AM**: Initial implementation or major update of `PlotBoxHubSpotService`. This service orchestrates the synchronization of PlotBox data to HubSpot. It fetches data, maps it using `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper`, and then processes contacts (primary and deceased) and deals, including creating associations with locations. It includes extensive error handling and logging at various stages of the sync process. A `dd($dealsBatch, $primaryContactBatch);` debugging statement was introduced.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:26:59 AM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 12:17:46 PM**: The debugging statement changed from `dd($dealsBatch, $primaryContactBatch);` to `dd($deceasedContactBatch);`.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 12:31:34 PM**: The `dd($deceasedContactBatch);` debugging statement was commented out.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:45:09 AM**: The debugging statement changed from `dd($dealsBatch, $primaryContactBatch);` to `dd($dealsBatch, $primaryContactBatch, $deceasedContactBatch);`.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:53:47 AM**: The `dd(...)` debugging statement was removed.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 3:21:42 PM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php`**
    *   **January 6, 2026, 3:15:57 PM**: Major update to the `PlotBox\Contact` Eloquent model. This includes a complex SQL query (`getDataWithDateRange`) using CTEs (Common Table Expressions) to fetch comprehensive contact, contract, writer, and item count data from Snowflake. The query filters by `LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC` on `DIM_CONTRACT` or `LAST_UPDATED_DATETIME` on `DIM_CONTACT` within a specified date range. It also logs the first result for debugging.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 10:29:41 AM**: A `LIMIT 1` clause was added to the main `SELECT` statement in `getDataWithDateRange` (effectively renaming the original to `getDataWithDateRange1`). This suggests a temporary change for testing or debugging, limiting the output to a single record.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 10:31:58 AM**: The `LIMIT 1` clause was removed from `getDataWithDateRange1`, reverting it to fetch all results. `FACILITY_ID` and `FACILITY_NAME` columns were added to the `SELECT` statement, joining with `DIM_FACILITY`.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 10:33:02 AM**: The `LIMIT 1` clause was re-added to `getDataWithDateRange1` in the main `SELECT` statement.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 10:40:26 AM**: Removed the join to `DIM_FACILITY` and the `FACILITY_ID`, `FACILITY_NAME` columns from the main `SELECT` in `getDataWithDateRange1`. The `Location_Cd` column changed from `df.FACILITY_SHORT_NAME` to `SUBSTRING(CAST(pc.CONTACT_KEY AS STRING), 1, 3)`.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 10:45:21 AM**: The original `getDataWithDateRange` was renamed to `getDataWithDateRange1`. A new `getDataWithDateRange` function was introduced, which appears to be a work-in-progress or temporary test function. This new function has hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filtering (`DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '660-1004010262'`) and commented-out date range and `EXISTS` conditions.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 10:52:47 AM**: The hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter (`DIM_CONTRACT.CONTRACT_NUMBER = '660-1004010262'`) and commented-out date range conditions in the newly introduced `getDataWithDateRange` method were restored to the original date range filter. The temporary `LIMIT 1` at the end of the query in `getDataWithDateRange1` was removed.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 10:55:03 AM**: The `WITH base_contracts AS (...)` part of `getDataWithDateRange` in the `app\Models\PlotBox\Contact.php` file had a typo (`WWITH`).
    *   **January 8, 2026, 10:55:38 AM**: The typo `WWITH` was corrected to `WITH` in `getDataWithDateRange`.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 11:00:21 AM**: The `CREATED_BY_KEY` column was removed from `DIM_CONTRACT` in `base_contracts` CTE in `getDataWithDateRange`.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 11:04:46 AM**: The `CREATED_BY_KEY` column was re-added to `DIM_CONTRACT` in `base_contracts` CTE in `getDataWithDateRange`. The `Location_Cd` column in the final `SELECT` statement changed from `df.FACILITY_SHORT_NAME` to `SUBSTRING(CAST(pc.CONTACT_KEY AS STRING), 1, 3)`. The join to `DIM_FACILITY` was removed.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 11:04:55 AM**: The `CREATED_BY_KEY` column was removed from the `primary_contacts` and `deceased_contacts` CTEs in the joins (`bc.CREATED_BY_KEY = dco.CREATED_BY_KEY` removed). `Location_Cd` in the final SELECT changed from `SUBSTRING(...)` back to `df.FACILITY_SHORT_NAME`. A join to `DIM_FACILITY` was added back.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 11:06:38 AM**: A duplicate `getDataWithDateRange1` function was created. The `CREATED_BY_KEY` column was added back to `DIM_CONTRACT` in `base_contracts` CTE in `getDataWithDateRange2`.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 11:09:22 AM**: `getDataWithDateRange2` function was removed. The join conditions for `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER` and `DIM_CONTACT` in `primary_contacts` and `deceased_contacts` CTEs were modified to use `CREATED_BY` instead of `CREATED_BY_KEY`.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 11:10:18 AM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 11:10:53 AM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 11:11:00 AM**: The original `getDataWithDateRange` was reverted to its state from before the changes on `1/8/2026, 10:45:21 AM`, meaning the hardcoded filter and commented conditions are gone, and it uses date range filtering. However, the `Location_Cd` column in the main `SELECT` statement now uses `SUBSTRING(CAST(pc.CONTACT_KEY AS STRING), 1, 3)` instead of joining to `DIM_FACILITY`.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 11:18:21 AM**: In `getDataWithDateRange1` and `getDataWithDateRange`, the join condition `dco.CONTACT_ID = dc.CONTACT_KEY` was changed to `dco.CONTACT_ID = dc.CONTACT_ID` for `DIM_CONTRACT_OWNER` and `DIM_CONTACT` in both primary and deceased contacts CTEs. Also, `DIM_CONTRACT.FACILITY_KEY` was changed to `DIM_CONTRACT.FACILITY_ID` in `base_contracts`. The join `LEFT JOIN DIM_FACILITY df ON pc.FACILITY_ID = df.FACILITY_ID` was added back, and `Location_Cd` now uses `df.FACILITY_SHORT_NAME`.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 11:19:46 AM**: In `getDataWithDateRange1` and `getDataWithDateRange`, the `dco.CONTRACT_KEY = dco.CONTRACT_ID` condition was changed to `bc.CONTRACT_KEY = dco.CONTRACT_ID` in `primary_contacts` and `deceased_contacts` CTEs. Also, `cw.CONTRACT_KEY` was changed to `cw.CONTRACT_ID` in `contract_writers` and the final `LEFT JOIN contract_writers` for the new `getDataWithDateRange` function (which was previously `getDataWithDateRange1`).
    *   **January 8, 2026, 11:41:47 AM**: In `getDataWithDateRange1` and `getDataWithDateRange`, the join condition `dco.CONTACT_ID = dc.CONTACT_KEY` was corrected to `dco.CONTACT_ID = dc.CONTACT_KEY` (reverted from `dc.CONTACT_ID` to `dc.CONTACT_KEY`).
    *   **January 8, 2026, 11:42:34 AM**: In `getDataWithDateRange1` and `getDataWithDateRange`, the join condition `dco.CONTACT_ID = dc.CONTACT_KEY` in the `EXISTS` clause was updated from `dco.CONTACT_ID = dc.CONTACT_KEY` to `dco.CONTACT_ID = dc.CONTACT_ID`. The `CONTRACT_ID` in `item_counts` and `contract_writers` was updated to `CONTRACT_KEY`.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 11:44:53 AM**: In `getDataWithDateRange1` and `getDataWithDateRange`, the `CONTRACT_ID` in `item_counts` and `contract_writers` was reverted to `CONTRACT_KEY`.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 11:48:11 AM**: In `getDataWithDateRange1` and `getDataWithDateRange`, the join conditions in `item_counts` were updated to use `FEE_ID` and `FEE_CATEGORY_ID` instead of `FEE_KEY`. The `contract_writers` and `item_counts` CTEs now use `CONTRACT_ID` instead of `CONTRACT_KEY` for their primary key and filter conditions. The `CREATED_BY` column was added to `primary_contacts` and `deceased_contacts` CTEs.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 12:23:40 PM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 12:25:13 PM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 12:29:38 PM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 8, 2026, 12:30:57 PM**: `CREATED_BY` column was added to the final `SELECT` statement as `Created_By_Key`.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:29:14 AM**: The `getDataWithDateRange` function reverted to a hardcoded `CONTRACT_NUMBER` filter and commented-out date range and `EXISTS` conditions, similar to an earlier debugging state. `LIMIT 1` was added to the end of the query.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 11:29:23 AM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 3:21:23 PM**: The `getDataWithDateRange` method was reverted to use date range filtering (`CAST(DIM_CONTRACT.LAST_UPDATED_DATE_TIME_UTC AS DATE) BETWEEN '{$fromDate}' AND '{$toDate}'`) instead of the hardcoded contract number. The `LIMIT 1` clause was removed from the query.

*   **`c:\Users\efeno\dev\datalink\app\helpers.php`**
    *   **January 9, 2026, 12:26:40 PM**: The `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` function was modified to convert a `DateTime` object to UTC and then multiply its timestamp by 1000 to get milliseconds. It also explicitly sets time to 00:00:00.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 12:26:57 PM**: The explicit `setTime(0, 0, 0)` call was removed from `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis`, meaning it would use the time from the input string if present.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 12:29:20 PM**: The `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` function was reverted to include `setTime(0, 0, 0)`.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 12:30:41 PM**: The `convert_utc_date_to_epoch` function was changed to `strtotime($dateString)` (removing `* 1000`), thus returning seconds instead of milliseconds.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 12:32:57 PM**: The `convert_utc_date_to_epoch` function was reverted to multiply by 1000, returning milliseconds.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 12:51:15 PM**: `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` was modified to construct `DateTime` with a default `America/New_York` timezone and then convert to UTC, explicitly setting the time to `00:00:00`.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 12:52:33 PM**: `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` was modified to append `' 00:00:00'` to the `$dateString` before creating the `DateTime` object, ensuring it's always set to midnight.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 12:54:35 PM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 12:58:10 PM**: A check `if ($timestamp < 0) return $dateString;` was added to `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` to handle invalid timestamp conversions.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 1:03:46 PM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 1:04:51 PM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 1:04:57 PM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 1:05:08 PM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 1:09:16 PM**: `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` was further refined to `substr(trim($dateString), 0, 10)` to ensure only the date part is used, and a `preg_match` validation was added for the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 1:09:50 PM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.
    *   **January 9, 2026, 1:10:08 PM**: No significant functional change; possibly a save operation.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **HubSpot Integration Focus**: The majority of changes revolve around integrating data with HubSpot CRM, including services for Contacts, Deals, Locations, and Owners.
2.  **API Token Management**: HubSpot API tokens are consistently retrieved from `config('services.hubspot.sources.<source>.api_access_token')`. The `__construct` methods of HubSpot service classes (`HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`, `HubSpotOwnerService`) were updated on January 2nd to accept nullable string for `$apiToken`, indicating a potential for optional API token provision or more flexible instantiation.
3.  **Date Handling and Conversion**: There's a recurring theme of converting date strings to Unix epoch milliseconds in UTC. This is evident in the `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` and in the `helpers.php` file, which saw multiple refinements to the `date_string_to_midnight_utc_millis` and `convert_utc_date_to_epoch` functions on January 9th. These changes include explicit timezone handling, setting time to midnight, handling empty/invalid date strings, and format validation.
4.  **Error Handling and Logging**: All HubSpot-related service classes (`HubSpotContactService`, `HubSpotDealService`, `HubSpotLocationService`, `HubSpotOwnerService`, `PlotBoxHubSpotService`) extensively use `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log` within `try-catch` blocks for API exceptions (`ApiException`) and general `Exception`s, ensuring robust error reporting and continuous processing where possible.
5.  **Debugging Practices**: Temporary debugging statements like `dd()` (dump and die) and `var_dump()` were frequently added and subsequently removed in the `HubSpotServiceProvider`, `HubSpotContactService`, and `PlotBoxHubSpotService` files, indicating an active development and debugging cycle.
6.  **Data Cleaning/Filtering**: Before sending data to HubSpot, various properties (`loc_id`, `last_update_dt`, `exists`, `service_type_code`, `hmis_account_number`) are consistently unset in both contact and deal services, suggesting a pattern of cleaning data before external API calls.
7.  **Data Mapping and Transformation**: The `PlotBoxDataToCrmMapper` performs significant data transformation, including trimming strings, uppercasing state names, standardizing relationship text, and normalizing pipeline/deal stage values, reflecting a need to align source data with CRM schema requirements.
8.  **Database Query Refinements**: The `PlotBox\Contact` model's SQL query (`getDataWithDateRange`) underwent numerous iterative changes, particularly between January 6th and 9th. These changes involved:
    *   Adjusting join conditions (e.g., `dco.CONTACT_KEY` vs `dco.CONTACT_ID`).
    *   Modifying column selections (e.g., `DIM_CONTRACT.FACILITY_KEY` vs `DIM_CONTRACT.FACILITY_ID`).
    *   Changing how `Location_Cd` is derived (from `DIM_FACILITY` join to a `SUBSTRING` of `CONTACT_KEY` and back).
    *   Temporarily introducing hardcoded filters (`CONTRACT_NUMBER`) and `LIMIT 1` clauses for debugging purposes.
    *   Refining join keys for `DIM_FEE` and `DIM_FEE_CATEGORY`.
    *   Adding `CREATED_BY` to the final select.
    These frequent adjustments highlight an ongoing effort to correctly extract and correlate data from the Snowflake warehouse.
